"The mechanism of high $T_{c}$ superconductivity remains enigmatic even after 15 years of its discovery[@BM]. It is well known that the central idea in the search of high $T_{c}$ materials was to look for materials with polaronic effects caused by coupling between electrons and the lattice. However, most recent theoretical debates are based on the assumption that the holes are homogeneously doped into CuO$_{2}$ planes, even if hole-doping is achieved by the substitution of ions with different ionicity which in effect creates alloys. A clear and widely accepted counter example against such a simplified picture is the stripe phase in Nd co-doped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$, where the Coulomb potential from the distorted lattice slows down spin and charge density waves [@Tranquada].

In the field model, the pentagonal rings in the fullerene are simulated by two kinds of gauge fields. The first one, non-abelian field, follows from so-called K spin rotation invariance for the spinor field while the second one describes the elastic flow due to pentagonal apical disclinations. For fullerene molecule, these fluxes are taken into account by introducing an effective field due to magnetic monopole placed at the center of a sphere.

"---\nabstract: 'Traditional recommender systems present a relatively static list of recommendations to a user where the feedback is typically limited to an accept/reject or a rating model. However, these simple modes of feedback may only provide limited insights as to why a user likes or dislikes an item and what aspects of the item the user has considered. Interactive recommender systems present an opportunity to engage the user in the process by allowing them to interact with the recommendations, provide feedback and impact the results in real-time. Evaluation of the impact of the user interaction typically requires an extensive user study which is time consuming and gives researchers limited opportunities to tune their solutions without having to conduct multiple rounds of user feedback. Additionally, user experience and design aspects can have a significant impact on the user feedback which may result in not necessarily assessing the quality of some of the underlying algorithmic decisions in the overall solution. As a result, we present an evaluation framework which aims to simulate the users interacting with the recommender. We formulate metrics to evaluate the quality of the interactive recommenders which are outputted by the framework once simulation is completed. While simulation"

For the braid groups $\\mathbf{B}_n$, Lawrence and Bigelow have constructed families of representations starting from actions of $\\mathbf{B}_n$ on the twisted homology of configuration spaces. These were then used by Bigelow and Krammer to prove that the braid groups are linear.\n\n    We develop a general underlying procedure to build homological representations of families of groups, encompassing all of the above-mentioned families and in principle many more, such as families of general motion groups. Moreover, these families of representations are *coherent*, in the sense that they extend to a functor on a larger category, whose automorphism groups are the family of groups under consideration and whose richer structure may be used (i) to organise the representation theory of the family of groups and (ii) to prove twisted homological stability results \u2014 both via the notion of *polynomiality*.

Our hyperbola inquiry is then switched to John Landen, an amateur mathematician, who probably was writing more to fix his priorities than to explain his remarkable findings.

With a chain of geometrical constructions, we attach our interpretation to Landen\u2019s treatment. Our modern analytical proof to his hyperbolic limit excess, by means of elliptic integrals of the first and second kind is also provided, and we demonstrate why the so called Landen transformation for the elliptic integrals cannot be ascribed to him.

This transformation can be described as attaching to each particle an infinitesimal flux tube carrying a fictitious flux $\\phi$ and a fictitious charge $q$, which couples to the vector potential produced by the flux tubes on every other particle in the standard way. If $q$ is equal to the electron charge and $\\phi$ is an even number times $\\phi_0=hc/e$, the quantum of flux, no change in statistics occurs. If $\\phi$ is and odd number times $\\phi_0$, Fermions are transformed into Bosons. The \u201cgauge field\u201d interactions associated with the fictitious charge and vector potential produced by the fictitious flux make the Hamiltonian of the system considerably more complicated.

Despite these being our main object of interest, we dedicate significant attention to the issues of compatibility of pseudo-metrics, and the gluing-dual commutativity condition, that is, the condition ensuring that the dual of the result of gluing together two pseudo-bundles can equivalently be obtained by gluing together their duals, which is not automatic in the diffeological context. We show that, assuming that the dual of the gluing map, which itself does not have to be a diffeomorphism, on the total space is one, the commutativity condition is satisfied, via a natural map, which in addition turns out to be an isometry for the natural pseudo-metrics on the pseudo-bundles involved.\n\n    MSC (2010): 53C15 (primary), 57R35, 57R45 (secondary).\nauthor:\n- 'Ekaterina\u00a0[<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">P</span>ervova]{}'\ntitle: 'Pseudo-bundles of exterior algebras as diffeological Clifford modules'\n---\n\nIntroduction {#introduction .unnumbered}\n============\n\nThis work is intended as a supplement to [@clifford-alg], dealing with some"

Unfortunately, the annotation process is notoriously tedious and expensive, especially for pixel-wise tasks like semantic segmentation. Recent works have proposed to rely on synthetically generated imagery to ease the training set creation. However, models trained on these kind of data usually under-perform on real images due to the well known issue of domain shift. We address this problem by learning a domain-to-domain image translation GAN to shrink the gap between real and synthetic images. Peculiarly to our method, we introduce semantic constraints into the generation process to both avoid artifacts and guide the synthesis.

Therefore it is inevitable that MGCs formed in dwarfs have HEAS. The abundance spread in each individual MGC depends on the radial metallicity gradient of the host dwarf such that it can be larger for the steeper metallicity gradient. For example, MGCs formed in a dwarf with a central metallicity of \\[Fe/H\\]$=-1.1$ and the radial gradient of $\\sim -0.2$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ can have the abundance spread of $\\Delta {\\rm [Fe/H]} \\sim 0.2$.

If an orbit passes through an invisible two-fold (also known as a Teixeira singularity) before settling to regular periodic motion, then the phase of that motion cannot be determined from initial conditions, and in the presence of small noise the asymptotic phase of a large number of sample solutions is highly random. In this paper we show how the probability distribution of the asymptotic phase depends on the global nonlinear dynamics. We also show how the phase of a smooth oscillator can be randomised by applying a simple discontinuous control law that generates an invisible two-fold.

"---\nabstract: 'We study the fermionic King model which may provide a relevant model of dark matter halos. The exclusion constraint can be due to quantum mechanics (for fermions such as massive neutrinos) or to Lynden-Bell\u2019s statistics (for collisionless systems undergoing violent relaxation).

Dwarf and intermediate size halos are degenerate quantum objects stabilized against gravitational collapse by the Pauli exclusion principle. Large halos at sufficiently high energies are in a gaseous phase where quantum effects are negligible. They are stabilized by thermal motion. Below a critical energy $E_c$ they undergo gravitational collapse (gravothermal catastrophe). This may lead to the formation of a central black hole that does not affect the structure of the halo. This may also lead to the formation of a compact degenerate object surrounded by a hot massive atmosphere extending at large distances. We argue that large dark matter halos should not contain a degenerate nucleus (fermion ball) because these nucleus-halo structures are thermodynamically unstable.

The nature of the operator is such that it does not introduce ghosts. We compute the cosmological scalar and tensor perturbations for this model, improving over an existing computation. We then confront these results with the Planck data. The model is characterized by the quantity $\\gamma \\equiv \\frac{g^2 Q^2}{H^2}$ (where $g$ is the gauge coupling constant, $Q$ the vector vev, and $H$ the Hubble rate). For $\\gamma < 2$, the scalar perturbations show a strong tachyonic instability. In the stable region, the scalar power spectrum $n_s$ is too low at small $\\gamma$, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is too high at large $\\gamma$.

"---\nabstract: 'Data on galaxies at high redshift, identified by the Lyman-break photometric technique, can teach us about how galaxies form and evolve. The stellar masses and other properties of such Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) depend sensitively on the details of star formation.

We find that, within the rather large uncertainties, recent estimates of the stellar masses of LBGs from multi-color photometry are consistent with the predictions of all three models. However, the estimated stellar masses are more consistent with the predictions of two of the models in which star formation is accelerated at high redshifts $z\\gsim3$, and of these models the one in which many of the LBGs are merger-driven starbursts is also more consistent with indications that many high redshift galaxies are gas rich.

"Introduction\n============\n\nIn recent years the nature of the non-exponential relaxation of glass-forming liquids close to $T_g$ has been elucidated by a variety of experimental techniques; see [@Ediger] and [@Boehmer] for an overview. One way of getting additional information is to analyse three-time besides the standard two-time correlation functions, as realized by multidimensional NMR experiments. On this basis it is possible to decide whether the non-exponentiality is mainly due to a homogeneous scenario (intrinsic non-exponentiality related to systematic back- and forth dynamics) or a heterogeneous scenario (superposition of different exponential processes). In a previous publication these concepts have been applied to computer simulations of a hard sphere system which experimentally is well represented by colloidal suspensions [@vanMegen]. There we observed that the dynamics at short times ($\\beta$-regime) is dominated by the presence of a cage formed by surrounding particles. This results in a systematic back-dragging effect, corresponding to a mainly homogeneous scenario. In the $\\alpha$-regime most particles have escaped their initial cages. Then they encounter fast or slow regions in the liquid, arising, e.g., from inhomogeneitities in density. The simplest model for this situation would be an ensemble of independently diffusing particles with different mobilities.\n\nThe goal of the present"

"---\nabstract: 'Unsupervised text style transfer aims to transfer the underlying style of text but keep its main content unchanged without parallel data. Most existing methods typically follow ***two steps***: first separating the content from the original style, and then fusing the content with the desired style. However, the separation in the first step is challenging because the content and style interact in subtle ways in natural language. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual reinforcement learning framework to directly transfer the style of the text via a ***one-step*** mapping model, without any separation of content and style. Specifically, we consider the learning of the source-to-target and target-to-source mappings as a dual task, and two rewards are designed based on such a dual structure to reflect the style accuracy and content preservation, respectively. In this way, the two one-step mapping models can be trained via reinforcement learning, without any use of parallel data. Automatic evaluations show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems by a large margin, especially with more than 8 BLEU points improvement averaged on two benchmark datasets. Human evaluations also validate the effectiveness of our model in terms of style accuracy, content preservation and fluency. Our"

Possible causes for this are considered in the context of a recently proposed eccentric binary model for KH 15D.

"---\nabstract: 'Solids with topologically robust electronic states exhibit unusual electronic and optical transport properties that do not exist in other materials. A particularly interesting example is chiral charge pumping, the so-called chiral anomaly, in recently discovered topological Weyl semimetals, where simultaneous application of parallel DC electric and magnetic fields creates an imbalance in the number of carriers of opposite topological charge (chirality). Here, using time-resolved terahertz measurements on the Weyl semimetal TaAs in a magnetic field, we optically interrogate the chiral anomaly by dynamically pumping the chiral charges and monitoring their subsequent relaxation. Theory based on Boltzmann transport shows that the observed effects originate from an optical nonlinearity in the chiral charge pumping process. Our measurements reveal that the chiral population relaxation time is much greater than 1 ns. The observation of terahertz-controlled chiral carriers with long coherence times and topological protection suggests the application of Weyl semimetals for quantum optoelectronic technology.'\nauthor:\n- 'M.

Our analysis of archival X-ray data, together with the detection of a transient radio source with luminosity typical of bright supernovae, give further evidence of the ongoing star formation activity, which dominates the energetics of the system. At sub-parsec scales, the radio nucleus has a core-jet morphology with the jet being a newly ejected component showing a subluminal proper motion of 0.6\u20131$c$.

"Introduction\n============\n\nSeveral years ago, Knapp raised the concept of motional or exchange narrowing in one-dimensional (1D) disordered systems\u00a0[@Knapp84] and fruitfully explained many optical phenomena in low-dimensional disordered systems like J\u00a0aggregates and conjugated polymers (for a review, see Refs.\u00a0[@Spano94; @Knoester96] and references therein). Roughly speaking, this author demonstrated that the disorder [*seen*]{} by the quasi-particles of the excited system is reduced as compared to the seeding degree of disorder, namely the width of the probability distribution of the on-site energy, as soon as the states of the individual molecules are collectivized due to the intermolecular interactions. The suppression factor depends on whether or not the disorder is small enough to be regarded as a perturbation. In the perturbative case, this factor is determined by the square root of the number of sites in the entire system, while in the nonperturbative case this number should be substituted by the so-called number of coherently bound molecules, due to the occurrence of the Anderson localization whenever the on-site energy is an [*uncorrelated*]{} random variable.\n\nNumerically simulated absorption spectrum of polysilane with an uncorrelated Gaussian distribution of nearest-neighbor couplings are similar to those for an uncorrelated diagonal disorder\u00a0[@Tilgner90].

"---\nabstract: 'Identification of pairing mechanisms leading to the unconventional superconductivity realized in copper-oxide, heavy-fermions, and organic compounds is one of the most challenging issues in condensed-matter physics. Clear evidence for an electron-phonon mechanism in conventional superconductors is seen by the isotope effect on the superconducting transition temperatures $T_{\\rm SC}$, since isotopic substitution varies the phonon frequency without affecting the electronic states. In unconventional superconductors, magnetic fluctuations have been proposed to mediate superconductivity, and considerable efforts have been made to unravel relationships between normal-state magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity. Here, we show that characteristic experimental results on the ferromagnetic (FM) superconductor UCoGe ($T_{\\rm Curie} \\sim 2.5 $ K and $T_{\\rm SC} \\sim 0.6$ K) can be understood consistently within a scenario of the spin-triplet superconductivity induced by FM spin fluctuations.

They occur when quantities such as correlation functions of local operators, or scattering amplitudes are computed in perturbation theory. Beyond the lowest order in perturbation theory, integrals over $D$-dimensional space time over (rational) propagator factors have to be evaluated.\n\nOur ability to evaluate Feynman integrals in perturbation theory is critical for connecting quantum field theory to experiment. For example, in order to make precise theoretical predictions for collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), higher-order Feynman integrals for complicated kinematical processes are a crucial ingredient, see e.g. [@Gehrmann:2014vva]. This not only applies to virtual amplitudes, but, via the optical theorem, also to phase space integrals and to cross sections [@Anastasiou:2002yz; @Anastasiou:2003yy]. Other applications include statistical field theory, where critical exponents can be computed; higher order calculations are also important for instance for a better theoretical description of the anomalous magnetic moments. From the mathematical point of view it is an interesting question to ask what class of functions Feynman integrals give rise to. These are typically functions of a set of parameters,"

Moreover, our experiments are done using a substantially larger dataset than earlier papers on this topic.

"---\nabstract: 'The brain is organized in a modular way, serving multiple functionalities. This multiplicity requires that both positive (e.g. excitatory, phase-coherent) and negative (e.g. inhibitory, phase-opposing) interactions take place across brain modules. Unfortunately, most methods to detect modules from time series either neglect or convert to positive any measured negative correlation. This may leave a significant part of the sign-dependent functional structure undetected. Here we present a novel method, based on random matrix theory, for the identification of sign-dependent modules in the brain. Our method filters out the joint effects of local (unit-specific) noise and global (system-wide) dependencies that empirically obfuscate such structure. The method is guaranteed to identify an optimally contrasted functional \u2018signature\u2019, i.e. a partition into modules that are positively correlated internally and negatively correlated across. The method is purely data-driven, does not use any arbitrary threshold or network projection, and outputs only statistically significant structure.

TLS is widely used in applied fields including computer vision, system identification and econometrics.

However, SVD cannot solve many important practical TLS problems with realistic noise structure, such as having varying measurement noise, known structure on the errors, or large outliers requiring robust error-norms. To solve such problems, we develop convex relaxation approaches for a general class of structured TLS (STLS). We show both theoretically and experimentally, that while the plain nuclear norm relaxation incurs large approximation errors for STLS, the re-weighted nuclear norm approach is very effective, and achieves better accuracy on challenging STLS problems than popular non-convex solvers.

"---\nabstract: 'In many large scale multiple testing applications, the hypotheses often have a known graphical structure, such as gene ontology in gene expression data. Exploiting this graphical structure in multiple testing procedures can improve power as well as aid in interpretation. However, incorporating the structure into large scale testing procedures and proving that an error rate, such as the false discovery rate (FDR), is controlled can be challenging. In this paper, we introduce a new general approach for large scale multiple testing, which can aid in developing new procedures under various settings with proven control of desired error rates. This approach is particularly useful for developing FDR controlling procedures, which is simplified as the problem of developing per-family error rate (PFER) controlling procedures. Specifically, for testing hypotheses with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure, by using the general approach, under the assumption of independence, we first develop a specific PFER controlling procedure and based on this procedure, then develop a new FDR controlling procedure, which can preserve the desired DAG structure among the rejected hypotheses. Through a small simulation study and a real data analysis, we illustrate nice performance of the proposed FDR controlling procedure for DAG-structured hypotheses.'\nauthor:"

One firstly builds up effective quasi-1D system and environment blocks of width $L$ and these quasi-1D blocks are then used to as the initial building-blocks of a new 2D infinite-lattice algorithm. This algorithm is found to be competitive with those results of previous 2D DMRG algorithms and also of the best of other approximate methods. An illustration of this is given for the spin-half and spin-one Heisenberg models on the square lattice. The best results for the ground-state energies per bond of the spin-half and spin-one square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnets for the $N = 20 \\times 20$ lattice using this treatment are given by $E_g/N_B = -0.3321$ and $E_g/N_B = -1.1525$, respectively.\n\n    PACS numbers: 75.10.Jm, 75.50Ee, 03.65.Ca\naddress: 'Imaging Science and Biomedical Engineering (ISBE), University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PT, United Kingdom'\nauthor:\n- 'D.J.J.

"---\nabstract: 'We unravel the nonequilibrium correlated quantum quench dynamics of an impurity traveling through a harmonically confined Bose-Einstein condensate in one-dimension. For weak repulsive interspecies interactions the impurity oscillates within the bosonic gas. At strong repulsions and depending on its prequench position the impurity moves towards an edge of the bosonic medium and subsequently equilibrates. This equilibration being present independently of the initial velocity, the position and the mass of the impurity is inherently related to the generation of entanglement in the many-body system. Focusing on attractive interactions the impurity performs a damped oscillatory motion within the bosonic bath, a behavior that becomes more evident for stronger attractions. To elucidate our understanding of the dynamics an effective potential picture is constructed. The effective mass of the emergent quasiparticle is measured and found to be generically larger than the bare one, especially for strong attractions. In all cases, a transfer of energy from the impurity to the bosonic medium takes place. Finally, by averaging over a sample of simulated in-situ single-shot images we expose how the single-particle density distributions and the two-body interspecies correlations can be probed.'\nauthor:\n- 'S.

"---\nabstract: 'In this article, we present a systematic study in developing machine learning interatomic potential (MLIAP) for elemental silicon. Previously, many of MLIAP applications involve fitting models to small or localized training sets, which do not allow for transferability. The need for transferability of MLIAP is crucial in sampling the vast phase space in the application of crystal structure prediction. To address for this need, we indicate that two primary factors can have major influences on the transferability of the MLIAP. First, transferability depends strongly on the diversity of the training data set. In particular, the use of a random structures generating algorithm based on crystal symmetry is a suitable methodology for generating a training data set with sufficient diversity. Second, we introduce a framework that allows Gaussian symmetry functions and bispectrum coefficients descriptors to be fitted with generalized linear regression or neural network. According to our substantial benchmark, the best accuracy trained on the diverse data set can be achieved by using a flexible machine learning method coupled with highly orthogonal descriptors. Therefore, we will show that neural network potential fitting with bispectrum coefficients as the descriptor is a feasible method for obtaining high-quality and transferable MLIAP.'\nauthor:"

It provided a full analytical description for stationary profiles and for important dynamic properties such as local accumulation times, variances and mean first-passage times.

It is found that the continuum models prediction about multiple time scales near the source region in two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems is not supported in our analysis.

Adsorption is the simplest technique to immobilize single polymers and a first step towards further visualization and manipulation using, e.g., modern scanning probe techniques [@SM01; @Sam04]. For manipulation, control over the shape of the adsorbed polymer is needed. In this article, we explore the possibility to achieve such shape control for semiflexible polymer rings using simple striped surface structures, which can be realized by topographical or chemical structuring. Whereas flexible polymers are governed by conformational entropy and typically adsorb in random coil configurations, the morphologies of semiflexible polymers with large persistence lengths are dominated by their bending rigidity, which gives rise to well-defined shapes: An open polymer adsorbs in a straight configuration, whereas a closed polymer ring forms a circular loop. Examples of such semiflexible rings are provided by DNA minicircles [@Mad06], carbon nanotubes [@Sano01] filamentous actin [@Tang01], and amyloid fibrils [@Hat03]. The shape of such semiflexible rings is of importance for biological issues such as the accessibility in transcription of viral genomes or plasmids or their"

For some time the common wisdom was that at any temperature the magnetic field should enhance the chiral condensate, an effect termed \u201cmagnetic catalysis\u201d (see [@Shovkovy:2012zn] for a review). This scenario was supported by calculations based on low-energy effective models and also by the first lattice QCD simulations.

"---\nabstract: |\n    We find a close correspondence between generalized Bell inequalities of a special kind and certain frustrated spin systems. For example, the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt inequality corresponds to the frustrated square with the signs $+++-$ for the nearest neighbor interaction between the spins. Similarly, the Pearle-Braunstein-Cave inequality corresponds to a frustrated even ring with the corresponding signs $+\\ldots +-$. Upon this correspondence, the violation of such inequalities by the entangled singlet state in quantum mechanics is equivalent to the spin system possessing a classical coplanar ground state, the energy of which is lower than the Ising ground state\u2019s energy. We propose a scheme which generates new inequalities and give further examples, the frustrated hexagon with additional diagonal bonds and the frustrated hypercubes in $n=3,4,5$ dimensions.

Particularly, present evolutionary optimization approaches generally start their search from scratch or the ground-zero state of knowledge, independent of how similar the given new problem of interest is to those optimized previously. There has thus been the apparent lack of automated knowledge transfers and reuse across problems. Taking the cue, this paper introduces a novel *Memetic Computational Paradigm for search*, one that models after how human solves problems, and embarks on a study towards intelligent evolutionary optimization of problems through the transfers of structured knowledge in the form of memes learned from previous problem-solving experiences, to enhance future evolutionary searches. In particular, the proposed memetic search paradigm is composed of four culture-inspired operators, namely, *Meme Learning*, *Meme Selection*, *Meme Variation* and *Meme Imitation*. The learning operator mines for memes in the form of latent structures derived from past experiences of problem-solving. The selection operator identifies the fit memes that replicate and transmit across problems, while the variation operator introduces innovations into the memes.

"---\nabstract: 'Penalized regression methods aim to retrieve reliable predictors among a large set of putative ones from a limited amount of measurements.

Large optimization problems associated with sparse reconstruction have been analyzed in the literature by setting up corresponding statistical mechanical models at a finite temperature. Using replica method for mean field approximation, and subsequently taking a zero temperature limit, this approach reproduces the algorithmic phase transition boundaries. Unfortunately, the replica trick and the non-trivial zero temperature limit obscure the underlying reasons for the failure of a sparse reconstruction algorithm, and of penalized regression methods, in general. In this paper, we employ the \u201ccavity method\u201d to give an alternative derivation of the mean field equations, working directly in the zero-temperature limit. This derivation provides insight into the origin of the different terms in the self-consistency conditions. The cavity method naturally involves a quantity, the average local susceptibility, whose behavior distinguishes different phases in this system. This susceptibility can be generalized for analysis of a broader class of sparse reconstruction algorithms.'"

"---\nabstract: 'The chemical separation of Li$^+$ ions induced by a magnetic field during the hierarchical structure formation can reduce initial Li abundances in cosmic structures. It is shown that cosmological reionization of neutral Li atoms quickly completes as soon as the first star is formed. Since almost all Li is singly ionized during the main course of structure formation, it can efficiently separate from gravitationally collapsing neutral gas. The separation is more efficient in smaller structures which formed earlier. In the framework of the hierarchical structure formation, extremely metal-poor stars can have smaller Li abundances because of their earlier formations. It is found that the chemical separation by a magnetic field thus provides a reason that Li abundances in extremely metal-poor stars are lower than the Spite plateau and have a large dispersion as well as an explanation of the Spite plateau itself. In addition, the chemical separation scenario can explain Li abundances in NGC 6397 which are higher than the Spite plateau.

The method is inspired by previous works on two-stage segmentation and variational Retinex. Our method consists of two stages. In the first stage, we decouple the image into reflection and illumination parts by solving a convex energy minimization model with either total variation or tight-frame regularisation. In the second stage, we segment the original image by thresholding on the reflection part, and the inhomogeneous intensity is estimated by the smoothly varying illumination part. We adopt a primal dual algorithm to solve the convex model in the first stage, and the convergence is guaranteed.

The latter can be enhanced in the renormalized $hhh$ coupling constant when the additional particles show the non-decoupling property. Therefore, even in the case where the $hZZ$ coupling is close to the SM value, deviation in the $hhh$ coupling from the SM value can become as large as plus $100$ percent, while that in the $hZZ$ coupling is at most minus $1$ percent level.

The photonic networks concerned in the paper consist of all-optical circuits incorporating photonic bandgap waveguides and driven resonators. The photonic transport flowing through waveguides are entirely determined from the exact master equation of the driven resonators. The master equation of the driven resonators is obtained by explicitly eliminating all the waveguide degrees of freedom while the back-reactions between resonators and waveguides are fully taken into account. The relations between the driven photonic dynamics and photocurrents are obtained. The non-Markovian memory structure and quantum coherence and decoherence effects in photonic transport are also fully included. This quantum transport theory unifies two fundamental nonequilibrium approaches, the Keldysh\u2019s nonequilibrium Green function technique and the Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach, together to make the investigation of the transient quantum photonic transport become more powerful.

"---\nabstract: |\n    Traditional thermoelectric Peltier coolers exhibit a cooling limit which is primarily determined by the figure of merit, *zT*. Rather than a fundamental thermodynamic limit, this bound can be traced to the difficulty of maintaining thermoelectric compatibility. Self-compatibility locally maximizes the cooler\u2019s coefficient of performance for a given $zT$ and can be achieved by adjusting the relative ratio of the thermoelectric transport properties that make up $zT$. In this study, we investigate the theoretical performance of thermoelectric coolers that maintain self-compatibility across the device.

In particular, it could have non-SM properties such as mixing with a singlet, non-standard couplings to the fermions, or other exotic decays. If one assumes a Higgs with SM couplings except additional decay channel to new particles, a branching ratio as large as 20% can be accommodated given the 2012 LHC data"

Disks are also the birthplace of planetary bodies. A particularly challenging problem is how to reconcile the relatively long timescales for planet formation ($>$10Myr, Bodenheimer et al.\u00a0[@bodenheimer00]) and the rather quick destruction of circumstellar disks (e.g.\u00a0Haisch et al.\u00a0[@haisch01a]). Amongst the many (yet) unanswered disk-related questions are: what are the timescales of disk dissipation; how does the chemical and physical evolution of dust proceed from small interstellar dust grains through pebble-sized particles to larger bodies? And how does the local physical environment (in particular in OB associations) influence these processes?\n\nCircumstellar disks have traditionally been identified from near-infrared (near-IR) colours ($JHK$). Recently, several L-band surveys of young stellar populations proved that the K-band excess is a rather incomplete and unreliable disk indicator. Furthermore, theoretical work on the IR signatures of circumstellar disks suggests that L-band observations can detect disks even for very low disk masses (Wood et al.\u00a0[@wood02])."

"---\nabstract: |\n    We develop a gauge theory for diffusive and precessional spin dynamics in two-dimensional electron gas with disorder. Our approach reveals a direct connections between the absence of the equilibrium spin current and strong anisotropy in the spin relaxation: both effects arise if the spin-orbit coupling is reduced to a pure gauge $SU(2)$ field. In this case, by a gauge transformation in the form of a local $%\n    SU(2)$ rotation in the spin subspace the spin-orbit coupling can be removed. The resulting spin dynamics is exactly described in terms of two kinetic coefficients: the spin diffusion and electron mobility. After the inverse transformation, full diffusive and precessional spin density dynamics, including the anisotropic spin relaxation, formation of stable spin structures, and spin precession induced by a macroscopic current, is restored. Explicit solutions of the spin evolution equations are found for the initially uniform spin density and for stable nonuniform structures.

"---\nabstract: 'This paper proposes a computationally efficient algorithm for distributed fusion in a sensor network in which multi-Bernoulli (MB) filters are locally running in every sensor node for multi-target tracking. The generalized Covariance Intersection (GCI) fusion rule is employed to fuse multiple MB random finite set densities. The fused density comprises a set of fusion hypotheses that grow exponentially with the number of Bernoulli components. Thus, GCI fusion with MB filters can become computationally intractable in practical applications that involve tracking of even a moderate number of objects. In order to accelerate the multi-sensor fusion procedure, we derive a theoretically sound approximation to the fused density. The number of fusion hypotheses in the resulting density is significantly smaller than the original fused density. It also has a parallelizable structure that allows multiple clusters of Bernoulli components to be fused independently. By carefully clustering Bernoulli components into isolated clusters using the GCI divergence as the distance metric, we propose an alternative to build exactly the approximated density without exhaustively computing all the fusion hypotheses. The combination of the proposed approximation technique and the fast clustering algorithm can enable a novel and fast GCI-MB fusion implementation. Our analysis shows that the"

"Introduction\n============\n\nThe equilibrium crystal shape (ECS) is that shape which, in the limit of infinitely large volume, yields the minimum free energy of a crystal. For a given arbitrary surface orientation and unit cell the atomic reconstruction that yields the lowest surface free energy can be determined. However, it is well known that in general this will not result in a thermodynamically stable situation, because the surface can further lower its energy by faceting on a macroscopic scale. The ECS provides a set of surface orientations that exist in thermodynamic equilibrium. Except for some situations with degenerate surface energies surfaces of any other orientations will facet.\n\nThe faceting of GaAs surfaces has been studied experimentally.

This behavior is in accordance with the fact that, unlike insulators, superconductors can support strong topological phases in one dimension.

By leveraging information from both supervising auxiliary variables and unlabeled data, we seek to uncover more scientifically interpretable group structures that may be hidden by completely unsupervised analyses. In this work, we propose and develop a new statistical pattern discovery method named Supervised Convex Clustering (SCC) that borrows strength from both information sources and guides towards finding more interpretable patterns via a joint convex fusion penalty. We develop several extensions of SCC to integrate different types of supervising auxiliary variables, to adjust for additional covariates, and to find biclusters. We demonstrate the practical advantages of SCC through simulations and a case study on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease genomics. Specifically, we discover new candidate genes as well as new subtypes of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease that can potentially lead to better"

Although a large Rashba splitting is expected to improve experimental accessibility of such phenomena, it has not been understood how we can maximally enhance this splitting. Here, we present a promising route to realize significant Rashba-type band splitting using a thin film heterostructure. Based on first-principles methods and analytic model analyses, a tantalate monolayer on BaHfO$_3$ is shown to host two-dimensional bands originating from Ta $t_{2g}$ states with strong Rashba spin splittings - up to nearly 10% of the bandwidth - at both the band minima and saddle points due to the maximal breaking of the inversion symmetry.

This paper applies machine learning techniques to improve the design of parametric reduced order models.

Also of importance is neuronal variability, a phenomenon in which a single neuron\u2019s inter-firing times may be highly variable. In this work, we aim to connect these two ideas by studying the effects of that variability on the capability of neurons to reach phase synchronization.

First, variability is shown to be correlated with the average degree of phase synchronization of the network. Next, restricting to spatial variability - which measures the deviation of firing times between all neurons in the network - we show that it is positively correlated to a behavior we call promiscuity, which is the tendency of neurons to to have their relative phases change with time. This relation is observed in all cases we tested, regardless of the degree of synchronization or the strength of the inter-neuronal coupling: high variability implies high promiscuity (low duration of phase-locking), even if the network as a whole is synchronized and the coupling is strong.

If a slinky is suspended from its top and stretched under gravity and then released, the bottom of the slinky does not begin to fall until the top section of the slinky, which collapses turn by turn from the top, collides with the bottom. The total collapse time $t_c$ (typically $\\sim 0.3$s for real slinkies) corresponds to the time required for a wave front to propagate down the slinky to communicate the release of the top end.

"---\ntitle: Optical absorption in Fibonacci lattices at finite temperature\n---\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nLow-dimensional quasiperiodic systems have been the subject of intensive theoretical studies because of their unusual properties, such as fractal energy spectra and self-similar wave functions. Several electronic properties of these systems can be inferred from optical measurements: In particular, optical absorption techniques are suitable for their characterization because cuasiperiodic order causes the occurrence of well-defined lines which do not arise in periodic or random systems [@PLA]. In previous works\u00a0[@PLA; @Macia94; @Adame95; @Adame96] we have focused our attention on Frenkel excitons in Fibonacci lattices as typical examples of low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems. By solving numerically the equation of motion of Frenkel excitons on the lattice, in which on-site energies take on two values following the Fibonacci sequence, we found that the characteristic satellites observed in the high-energy side of the absorption spectra correspond to well-defined peaks of the Fourier transform of the lattice. This result is important since it enables us to find a simple relationship between the underlying long range order and optical measurements. Due to the long-range nature of Fibonacci order, it is clear that quantum coherence of excitons over large distances is required to observe"

However, quantification of body composition requires an accurate segmentation of fat, muscle and other tissues from MR images, which remains a challenging goal due to the intensity overlap between them. In this study, we propose a fully automated, data-driven image segmentation platform that addresses multiple difficulties in segmenting MR images such as varying inhomogeneity, non-standardness, and noise, while producing high-quality definition of different tissues. In contrast to most approaches in the literature, we perform segmentation operation by combining three different MRI contrasts and a novel segmentation tool which takes into account variability in the data.

"---\nabstract: 'Over two thousand Galactic microlensing events have been discovered so far. All of them can be explained by events caused by single or multiple lenses (including binaries and planetary companions). However, when a microlensing event occurs in highly dense star fields such as in the Galactic bulge or in a globular cluster, it is necessarily affected by the shear from the global distribution of mass near the lens star. We investigate the distortions due to this shear in the microlensing light curves and in the astrometric microlensing centroid shift trajectories. As expected, the light curve deviation increases as the shear increases and the impact parameter decreases. Although the light curve in the presence of a small shear is similar to the simple Paczy\u0144ski curve with a slightly smaller impact parameter, the detailed difference between the light curve with and without shear reflects the direction and the magnitude of the shear.

Since the scaling solution characterized by the constant ratio $\\rho_X/\\rho_m$ is one way out for avoiding such a problem, we study the evolution of perturbations for a scaling dark energy model in the framework of GLPV theories in the Jordan frame. Provided the oscillating mode of scalar perturbations is fine-tuned so that it is initially suppressed, the anisotropic parameter $\\eta=-\\Phi/\\Psi$ between the two gravitational potentials $\\Psi$ and $\\Phi$ significantly deviates from 1 for $c_{\\rm t}^2$ away from"

Our correlation metric is a variation on the one introduced by Baiesi and Paczuski (2004). A network of earthquakes is constructed, which is time ordered and with links between the more correlated ones. Data pertaining to the California region has been used in the study. Recurrences to earthquakes are identified employing correlation thresholds to demarcate the most meaningful ones in each cluster. The distribution of recurrence lengths and recurrence times are analyzed subsequently to extract information about the complex dynamics. We find that the unimodal feature of recurrence lengths helps to associate typical rupture lengths with different magnitude earthquakes. The out-degree of the network shows a hub structure rooted on the large magnitude earthquakes. In-degree distribution is seen to be dependent on the density of events in the neighborhood.

Achieving better performance in these tasks generally boils down to differentiating Line-Of-Sight (LOS) from Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signal propagation reliably which generally requires expensive/specialized hardware due to the complex nature of indoor environments. Hence, the development of low-cost accurate positioning systems that exploit available infrastructure is not entirely solved.

"---\nabstract: 'Two recent arguments for linear dynamics in quantum theory are critically re-examined. Neither argument is found to be satisfactory as it stands, although an improved version of one of the arguments can in fact be given. This improved version turns out to be still not completely unproblematic, but it is argued that it contains only a single actual loophole, which is identical to a loophole that remains in experimental proofs of nonlocality of Bell-type. It is concluded that - within the context of the standard quantum kinematical framework and in agreement with what has been concluded by earlier authors - a nonlinear dynamics of density operators is inconsistent with relativistic causality. However, it is also stressed that this conclusion in itself has little implication for the nature of dynamics at the Hilbert space level - in particular, it does not force dynamics to be linear at this level - nor does it continue to be valid in contexts that go beyond the standard quantum kinematical framework.

"Superfluidity is an intriging concept which dates back to the discovery of He\u2013II [@Kapitza], and which is by now textbook material. Among the properties of a superfluid there are irrotational flows, quantization of circulation and stability of persistent currents. The theoretical disadvantage of He\u2013II is that the strong interactions which take place in the liquid prevent a simple microscopical description of the system, and make it impossible to clearly untangle the ultimate cause of superfluidity.\n\nThe achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation with ultracold atomic gases has revived the interest on a theoretical description of superfluidity. The first reason is that Bose\u2013Einstein condensation has long been thought to be the cause for the superfluid behavior in He\u2013II [@Feynmann]. But the second reason is that gaseous condensates can be accurately described with simple mean field models that can be subject of both analytic and numerical study [@Dalfovo].\n\nIn the last few years, the superfluid nature of these condensates has got experimental demonstrations by several means. One of the most striking features of superfluids is the quantization of circulation, which leads to the existence and [*stability*]{} of vortices even with the lack of external forcing.

"---\nabstract: '\u00a0 This paper studies a variant of the multi-type contact process as a model for the competition between cooperators and defectors on integer lattices. Regardless of their type, individuals die at rate one. Defectors give birth at a fixed rate whereas cooperators give birth at a rate that increases linearly with the number of nearby cooperators. In particular, it is assumed that only cooperators benefit from cooperators, which is referred to as kin-recognition in the ecological literature. To understand how the inclusion of space in the form of local interactions affects the dynamics, the results for the interacting particle system are compared with their counterpart for the non-spatial mean-field model. Due to some monotonicity with respect to the parameters, both the spatial and non-spatial models exhibit a unique phase transition. Our analysis shows however a major difference: In the spatial model, when cooperation is strong enough, the cooperators out-compete the defectors even when starting at arbitrarily low density. In contrast, regardless of the strength of cooperation, when the initial density of cooperators is too low, the defectors out-compete the cooperators in the non-spatial model.

We develop a general framework to describe transitions in the context that both geometries involved are represented as sub-geometries of a larger ambient geometry. Specializing to the setting of real projective geometry, we classify the geometric limits of any sub-geometry whose structure group is a symmetric subgroup of the projective general linear group.

In the calculations there are many systematic errors, [*e.g.*]{}, calculating at one finite lattice spacing with quenched approximation, and using the reduction with tree level ChPT. The indirect method might cause larger systematic errors than other sources, because the final state interaction of the two-pion is expected to play an important role in the decay process. Thus we have to treat the scattering effect of the two-pion state"

Specifically, we present the followings: (i) For every CSP, we construct an oracle that serves an access, in constant time, to a nearly optimal solution to a basic LP relaxation of the CSP. (ii) Using the oracle, we give a constant-time rounding scheme that achieves an approximation ratio coincident with the integrality gap of the basic LP. (iii) Finally, we give a generic conversion from integrality gaps of basic LPs to hardness results. All of those results are *unconditional*. Therefore, for every bounded-degree CSP, we give the best constant-time approximation algorithm among all.\n\n    A CSP instance is called $\\epsilon$-far from satisfiability if we must remove at least an $\\epsilon$-fraction of constraints to make it satisfiable.

"---\nabstract: 'The transversely confined propagating modes of an optical fiber mediate virtually infinite range energy exchanges among atoms placed within their field, which adds to the inherent free space dipole-dipole coupling. Typically, the single atom free space decay rate largely surpasses the emission rate into the guided fiber modes. However, scaling up the atom number as well as the system size amounts to entering a collective emission regime, where fiber-induced superradiant spontaneous emission dominates over free space decay. We numerically study this super- and subradiant decay of highly excited atomic states for one or several transverse fiber modes as present in hollow core fibers. As particular excitation scenarios we compare the decay of a totally inverted state to the case of $\\pi/2$ pulses applied transversely or along the fiber axis as in standard Ramsey or Rabi interferometry. While a mean field approach fails to correctly describe the initiation of superradiance, a second-order approximation accounting for pairwise atom-atom quantum correlations generally proves sufficient to reliably describe superradiance of ensembles from two to a few hundred particles. In contrast, a full account of subradiance requires the inclusion of all higher order quantum correlations. Considering multiple guided modes introduces a natural effective"

In this paper, we consider the path planner of an autonomous car that decides, at each timestep, the short-term path to follow in the next few seconds; such decision is done by using a weighted cost function that considers different aspects (safety, comfort, etc.). In order to assess whether all the possible decisions that can be taken by the path planner are covered by a given test suite $T$, we propose a mutation-based approach that mutates the weights of the cost function and then checks if at least one scenario of $T$ *kills* the mutant.

One of the candidates for the theory beyond the Standard Model is the walking technicolor which is the strongly coupled gauge theory having a large anomalous dimension $\\gamma_m \\simeq 1$ and approximate scale invariance due to the almost non-running (walking) coupling [@Yamawaki:1985zg; @Akiba:1985rr]. The walking behavior is in fact realized in the QCD with large number of (massless) flavors $N_f$ which possesses Caswell-Banks-Zaks infrared fixed point (IRFP) [@beta] in the two-loop beta function. The exact IRFP would be washed out by the dynamical generation of a quark mass $m$ in the very infrared region $\\mu<m$ for $N_f < N_f^{cr}$, $N_f^{cr}$ being the critical number. However, for $N_f$ very close to $N_f^{cr}$, $m$ could be much smaller than the intrinsic scale $\\Lambda$ ($\\gg  m $), an analogue of $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$, beyond which the coupling runs as the asymptotically free theory, so that the coupling remains almost walking for the wide infrared region $m<\\mu<\\Lambda$ as a remnant of the would-be IRFP.

Such loci cannot be predicted by single-star evolution theory. However, stars with such properties contribute significantly to the integrated light of the cluster.

We study the topological and metric properties of the space of GENEOs to evaluate their approximating power and set the basis for general strategies to initialise and compose operators. We begin by defining suitable pseudo-metrics for the function spaces, the equivariance groups, and the set of non-expansive operators. Basing on these pseudo-metrics, we prove that the space of GENEOs is compact and convex, under the assumption that the function spaces are compact and convex. These results provide fundamental guarantees in a machine learning perspective. We show examples on the MNIST and fashion-MNIST datasets.

"---\nabstract: 'Planets interact with their host stars through gravity, radiation and magnetic fields, and for those giant planets that orbit their stars within $\\sim$10 stellar radii ($\\sim$0.1 AU for a sun-like star), star-planet interactions (SPI) are observable with a wide variety of photometric, spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric studies. At such close distances, the planet orbits within the sub-alfv\u00e9nic radius of the star in which the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the two bodies is particularly efficient. The magnetic interactions appear as enhanced stellar activity modulated by the planet as it orbits the star rather than only by stellar rotation. These SPI effects are informative for the study of the internal dynamics and atmospheric evolution of exoplanets. The nature of magnetic SPI is modeled to be strongly affected by both the stellar and planetary magnetic fields, possibly influencing the magnetic activity of both, as well as affecting the irradiation and even the migration of the planet and rotational evolution of the star. As phase-resolved observational techniques are applied to a large statistical sample of hot Jupiter systems, extensions to other tightly orbiting stellar systems, such as smaller planets close to M dwarfs become possible. In these systems, star-planet separations"

The produced partons reduce their virtuality through gluon radiation and quark-antiquark splittings, and finally fragment into hadrons at scales approaching 0.2($\\Lambda_\\mathrm{QCD}$). Usually, one separates the produced hadrons into two classes: those coming directly from the fragmentation of partons resulting from the scattering with the largest momentum transfer (hard scattering) in the event, and the rest (underlying event, or UE). The UE thus consists of hadrons coming from (i) initial- and final-state radiation (ISR, FSR) from the hard scattering, (ii) softer partonic scatters in the same $\\Pp\\Pp$ collision (multiple parton interactions, or MPI) possibly with their own initial- and final-state radiation, and (iii) proton remnants concentrated along the beam direction.\n\nAn accurate understanding of the UE is required for precise measurements of standard model processes at high energies and searches for new"

This is commonly called Hawking radiation. Hawking radiation is one of very important phenomena where both of general relativity and quantum theory play a role. After Hawking\u2019s original derivation [@haw01], various derivations of Hawking radiation have been suggested.\n\nA method of deriving Hawking radiation based on quantum tunneling was proposed by Parikh and Wilczek [@par01]. The essential idea is as follows. We consider that a particle-antiparticle pair is formed close to the horizon inside a black hole. We can divide the field associated with a particle into ingoing modes moving toward the center of the black hole and outgoing modes trying to move outside the black hole. The ingoing modes are trapped inside the horizon. On the other hand, although the horizon plays a role of a barrier when the outgoing modes try to move outside the black hole, a part of the outgoing modes move outside the"

The electrons are also loaded with an axial velocity component, $v_z$ that mimics their bouncing motion between the electrostatic end plugs of a Penning-Malmberg trap. This $v_z$ loading facilitates 3D elastic and excitation collisions of the electrons with background neutrals under a MCC scheme. In the present set of numerical experiments, the electrons do not ionize the neutrals. This helps in separating out only the effect of non-ionizing collisions of electrons on the dynamics of the cloud.

One challenge lies in developing algorithmically efficient methods to visualize large and complex data sets. Another challenge is to develop effective visualizations that make the underlying patterns and trends easy to see. Even tougher is the challenge of providing interactive access, analysis, and filtering. All of these tasks become even more difficult with the size of the data sets arising in modern applications. In this paper we describe [*maps of computer science*]{} ([MoCS]{}), a functional visualization system for a large relational data set, based on spatialization and map representations.\n\n[*Spatialization*]{} is the process of assigning 2D or 3D coordinates to abstract data points, ideally in such a way that the spatial mapping has much of the characteristics of the original (higher dimensional) space.

"---\nabstract: 'A strongly naked singularity (SNS) was modelled at the center of the Galaxy. This specific type of naked singularity was characterized in 2008 by Virbhadra and Keeton. The lens is described using the Janis-Newman-Winicour metric, which has an ordinary mass and massless scalar charge parameters. Gravitational lensing by the SNS gives rise to 4 images: 2 images on the same side as the source and 2 images on the opposite side of the source from the optic axis. We compute magnification centroid, magnification centroid shift, and total absolute magnification for many values of the angular source position. The nature of the curve for all three results are qualitatively similar to Schwarzschild black hole lenses, but quantitatively different. Magnification centroid increases as angular source position increases. As angular source position increases, magnification centroid shift increases to a maximum value, and then begins to decrease. As angular source position becomes large, magnification centroid shift will approach zero. Total magnification is large for small values of angular source position, and decreases to a limiting value of one. The results expand upon previous work on an SNS of $\\nu$ = 0.01.

"---\nabstract: 'Effect algebras, introduced by Foulis and Bennett in 1994, are partial algebras which generalize some well known classes of algebraic structures (for example orthomodular lattices, MV algebras, orthoalgebras etc.). In the present paper, we introduce a new class of effect algebras, called [*homogeneous effect algebras*]{}. This class includes orthoalgebras, lattice ordered effect algebras and effect algebras satisfying Riesz decomposition property. We prove that every homogeneous effect algebra is a union of its blocks, which we define as maximal sub-effect algebras satisfying Riesz decomposition property. This generalizes a recent result by Rie\u010danov\u00e1, in which lattice ordered effect algebras were considered. Moreover, the notion of a block of a homogeneous effect algebra is a generalization of the notion of a block of an orthoalgebra. We prove that the set of all sharp elements in a homogeneous effect algebra $E$ forms an orthoalgebra $E_S$. Every block of $E_S$ is the center of a block of $E$. The set of all sharp elements in the compatibility center of $E$ coincides with the center of $E$.

The coronagraph manipulates the phase in the pupil to produce three beams yielding two coronagraphic point-spread functions (PSFs) and one faint leakage PSF.

The coronagraphic optic is manufactured using a direct-write technique for precise control of the liquid crystal pattern, and multitwist retarders for achromatization.

"---\nabstract: 'In a popular scenario due to Heyl, quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) which are seen during type 1 X-ray bursts are produced by giant travelling waves in neutron-star oceans. Piro and Bildsten have proposed that during the burst cooling the wave in the bursting layer may convert into a deep crustal interface wave, which would cut off the visible QPOs. This cut-off would help explain the magnitude of the QPO frequency drift, which is otherwise overpredicted by a factor of several in Heyl\u2019s scenario. In this paper, we study the coupling between the bursting layer and the deep ocean. The coupling turns out to be weak and only a small fraction of the surface-wave energy gets transferred to that of the crustal-interface wave during the burst.

A similar hierarchical structure is observed across many other biological, electronic, and transportation networks supporting complex functions.

In this paper, we formalize this problem, introduce the first algorithm to learn an $\\epsilon$-accurate estimate of the dynamics, and provide its sample complexity analysis. While this algorithm enjoys strong guarantees in the large-sample regime, it tends to have a poor performance in early stages of exploration. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm that is based on maximum weighted entropy, a heuristic that stems from common sense and our theoretical analysis. The main idea here is cover the entire state-action space with the weight proportional to the noise in the transitions.

Photochemical processes that directly convert photons to configurational changes are particularly attractive for actuation. Various researchers have demonstrated light-induced actuation with liquid crystal elastomers combined with azobenzene photochromes. We present a simple modeling framework and a series of examples that studies actuation by light. Of particular interest is the generation of cyclic or periodic motion under steady illumination. We show that this emerges as a result of a coupling between light absorption and deformation. As the structure absorbs light and deforms, the conditions of illumination change, and this in turn changes the nature of further deformation.

For instance, to rapidly try out flexible and non-conventional modeling ideas, researchers tend to use modern imperative deep-learning frameworks like PyTorch[^1] or TensorFlow Eager[^2]. These frameworks provide an easy, eager-execution interface that facilitates writing advanced and dynamic models quickly, but also suffer from overhead in latency at inference and impose deployment challenges. In contrast, production-oriented systems are typically written in declarative frameworks that express the model as a static graph, such as Caffe2[^3] and Tensorflow[^4]. While being highly optimized for production scenarios, they are often harder to use, and make the experimentation life-cycle much longer.

The two main causes of space charge are doping and imbalanced transport. Although these are completely different phenomena, they lead to the same voltage dependence of the photocurrent, making them difficult to distinguish. In this work, a method is introduced how the build-up of space charge due to imbalanced transport can be monitored in a real operating organic solar cell. The method is based on the reconstruction of quantum efficiency spectra and requires only optical input parameters that are straightforward to measure. This makes it suitable for the screening of new OPV materials. Furthermore, numerical and analytical means are derived to predict the impact of imbalanced transport on the charge collection. It is shown that when charge recombination is sufficiently reduced, balanced transport is not a necessary condition for efficient thick-film OPVs.'\nauthor:\n- Sebastian Wilken\n- 'Oskar J.

Our calculated elastic constants ($c_{11}$ = 641 GPa, $c_{12}$ = 159 GPa, $c_{13}$ = 128 GPa, $c_{33}$ = 1037 GPa, and $c_{44}$ = 271 GPa), bulk modulus ($B$ $\\approx$ 350 GPa) and hardness ($H$ $\\approx$ 46 GPa) are in good agreement with the reported experimental data. The calculated phonon density of states (DOS) agrees very well with our neutron vibrational spectroscopy result. Electronic and phonon analysis indicates that the strong covalent B-B and Re-B bonding is the main reason for the super incompressibility and hardness of ReB$_2$. The thermal expansion coefficients, calculated within the quasi-harmonic approximation and measured by neutron powder diffraction, are found to be nearly isotropic in $a$ and $c$ directions and only slightly larger than that of diamond in terms of magnitude.

We complement recent studies of this observable within the context of the Pentagon Operator Product Expansion, via the dual superWilson loop description, by studying effects of multiple scalar exchanges that accompany (or not) massive flux-tube excitations. Due to the fact that holes have a very small, nonperturbatively generated mass $m_{\\rm h}$ which is exponentially suppressed in the \u2019t Hooft coupling, their exchanges must be resummed in the ultraviolet limit, $\\tau \\ll m_{\\rm h}$. This procedure yields a contribution to the expectation value of the superloop which enters on equal footing with the classical area, \u2014 a phenomenon which was earlier observed for MHV amplitudes. In all components, the near-massless scalar exchanges factorize from the ones of massive particles, at leading order in strong coupling.\n\n0\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe equivalence between $N$-gluon maximally helicity-violating (MHV) scattering amplitudes in planar maximally supersymmetric gauge theory and the expectation value of the Wilson loop on a null polygonal contour $C_N$"

Four modern NM yield functions were verified: Mi13 [@mishev13], Ma16 [@mangeard2], CM12 [@caballero12] and CD00 [@clem00], on the basis of the cosmic-ray spectra measured by AMS-02. The Mi13 yield function was found to realistically represent the NM response to galactic cosmic rays. CM12 yield function leads to a small skew in the solar cycle dependence of the scaling factor.

"---\nabstract: 'We develop a microscopic theory for the relaxation dynamics of an optically pumped two-level system (TLS) coupled to a bath of weakly interacting Bose gas. Using Keldysh formalism and diagrammatic perturbation theory, expressions for the relaxation times of the TLS Rabi oscillations are derived when the boson bath is in the normal state and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state. We apply our general theory to consider an irradiated quantum dot coupled with a boson bath consisting of a two-dimensional dipolar exciton gas. When the bath is in the BEC regime, relaxation of the Rabi oscillations is due to both condensate and non-condensate fractions of the bath bosons for weak TLS-light coupling and dominantly due to the non-condensate fraction for strong TLS-light coupling. Our theory also shows that a phase transition of the bath from the normal to the BEC state strongly influences the relaxation rate of the TLS Rabi oscillations. The TLS relaxation rate is approximately independent of the pump field frequency and monotonically dependent on the field strength when the bath is in the low-temperature regime of the normal phase. Phase transition of the dipolar exciton gas leads to a non-monotonic dependence of the TLS relaxation rate"

The character of non-exciting of the material qubits does not change the state of material qubit and thus ensures the possibility of purifying entangled states by using more photons under realistic imperfect parameters.

We employed general relativity successfully to describe the galactic velocity profiles of four galaxies: NGC 2403, NGC 2903, NGC 5055 and the Milky Way. Here we map the density contours of the galaxies, achieving good concordance with observational data. In our Solar neighbourhood, we found a mass density and density fall-off fitting observational data satisfactorily. From our GR results, using the threshold density related to the observed optical zone of a galaxy, we had found that the Milky Way was indicated to be considerably larger than had been believed to be the case. To our knowledge, this was the only such existing theoretical prediction ever presented. Very recent observational results by Xu et al. have confirmed our prediction. As in our previous studies, galactic masses are consistently seen to be higher than the baryonic mass determined from observations but still notably lower than those deduced from the approaches relying upon dark matter in a Newtonian context.

The construction of synthetic spacecraft data, based on the quasi-linear premise\u2014that some characteristics of magnetized plasma turbulence can be usefully modeled as a collection of randomly phased, linear wave modes\u2014is described in detail.

While the results of the off-line methods are attractive, the proposed algorithms are ill-conditioned in many cases so that they requires special attention. As an alternative to the off-line method in this paper we propose and analyze on-line empirical characteristic function methods. Such recursive methods enables us to carry out real-time statistical analysis as new data points are processed instantly. In constructing these algorithms we follow the general framework proposed by Djereveckii and Fradkov , see [@djerev], and Ljung, see [@ljung_scheme]. On-line methods are also used to complement a computationally expensive off-line identification method. Namely, it would be uneconomical to re-estimate $\\theta^*$ using the off-line method when a new data point is received. Instead, we can argue that only a refinement of the estimate $\\hat{\\theta}_N$ should be computed using the newly received data point.

It is generally accepted that the progenitors of these hot, compact objects (20,000 $\\lesssim T_{\\rm eff} \\lesssim$ 40,000 K and 5.0 $\\lesssim \\log{g} \\lesssim$ 6.2) lose too large a fraction of their envelope mass near the tip of the first red giant branch (RGB) to ignite hydrogen-shell burning during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. They instead settle on the extreme horizontal branch (EHB), where they spend around 10$^8$ years as helium-core burning objects surrounded by an inert hydrogen-rich envelope before joining the white dwarf cooling track. However, the circumstances leading to the very fine-tuned mass loss necessary to produce an sdB star are still under debate. Formation channels proposed feature single star and binary evolution in different flavours, including increased mass loss due to helium-enrichment (e.g. @sweigart1997), the \u201chot flasher\u201d scenario (e.g. @d'cruz1996), common envelope"
"---\nabstract: 'Models for the origin of the slow solar wind must account for two seemingly-contradictory observations: The slow wind has the composition of the closed-field corona, implying that it originates from the continuous opening and closing of flux at the boundary between open and closed field. On the other hand, the slow wind also has large angular width, up to $\\sim 60^\\circ$, suggesting that its source extends far from the open-closed boundary. We propose a model that can explain both observations. The key idea is that the source of the slow wind at the Sun is a network of narrow (possibly singular) open-field corridors that map to a web of separatrices and quasi-separatrix layers in the heliosphere. We compute analytically the topology of an open-field corridor and show that it produces a quasi-separatrix layer in the heliosphere that extends to angles far from the heliospheric current sheet. We then use an MHD code and MDI/SOHO observations of the photospheric magnetic field to calculate numerically, with high spatial resolution, the quasi-steady solar wind and magnetic field for a time period preceding the August 1, 2008 total solar eclipse.

Truncating the power series provides (i) an efficient approximation scheme for computing the synchronized solution, and (ii) a simple-to-check, statistically-correct hierarchy of increasingly accurate synchronization tests.

"---\nabstract: |\n    Gas disks of spiral galaxies can be described as clumpy accretion disks without a coupling of viscosity to the actual thermal state of the gas. The model description of a turbulent disk consisting of emerging and spreading clumps [@Vollmer] contains free parameters, which can be constrained by observations of molecular gas, atomic gas and the star formation rate for individual galaxies. Radial profiles of 18 nearby spiral galaxies from THINGS, HERACLES, SINGS, and GALEX data are used to compare the observed star formation efficiency, molecular fraction, and velocity dispersion to the model. The observed radially decreasing velocity dispersion can be reproduced by the model. In the framework of this model the decrease in the inner disk is due to the stellar mass distribution which dominates the gravitational potential. Introducing a radial break in the star formation efficiency into the model improves the fits significantly. This change in star formation regime is realized by replacing the free fall time in the prescription of the star formation rate with the molecule formation timescale. Depending on the star formation prescription, the break radius is located near the transition region between the molecular-gas-dominated and atomic-gas-dominated parts of the galactic disk or"

In general, those weights contain diverging integrals over free variables and require a well-defined constructive prescription in order to render them finite up to certain ambiguities, which get fixed by employing suitable normalization conditions. Such a prescription is called renormalization scheme, if it fulfills additionally physically reasonable properties among which are unitarity, covariance and causality.

"---\nabstract: 'State-of-the-art video action recognition models with complex network architecture have archived significant improvements, but these models heavily depend on large-scale well-labeled datasets. To reduce such dependency, we propose a self-supervised teacher-student architecture, i.e., the Differentiated Teachers Guided self-supervised Network (DTG-Net). In DTG-Net, except for reducing labeled data dependency by self-supervised learning (SSL), pre-trained action related models are used as teacher guidance providing prior knowledge to alleviate the demand for a large number of unlabeled videos in SSL. Specifically, leveraging the years of effort in action-related tasks, e.g., image classification, image-based action recognition, the DTG-Net learns the self-supervised video representation under various teacher guidance, i.e., those well-trained models of action-related tasks. Meanwhile, the DTG-Net is optimized in the way of contrastive self-supervised learning. When two image sequences are randomly sampled from the same video or different videos as the positive or negative pairs, respectively, they are then sent to the teacher and student networks for feature embedding. After that, the contrastive feature consistency is defined between features embedding of each pair, i.e., consistent for positive pair and inconsistent for negative pairs. Meanwhile, to reflect various teacher tasks\u2019 different guidance, we also explore different weighted guidance on teacher tasks. Finally,"

"---\nabstract: |\n    In this paper, drawing intuition from the Turing test, we propose using adversarial training for open-domain dialogue generation: the system is trained to produce sequences that are indistinguishable from human-generated dialogue utterances. We cast the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem where we jointly train two systems, a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator\u2014analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test\u2014 to distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. The outputs from the discriminator are then used as rewards for the generative model, pushing the system to generate dialogues that mostly resemble human dialogues.\n\n    In addition to adversarial training we describe a model for adversarial [*evaluation*]{} that uses success in fooling an adversary as a dialogue evaluation metric, while avoiding a number of potential pitfalls. Experimental results on several metrics, including adversarial evaluation, demonstrate that the adversarially-trained system generates higher-quality responses than previous baselines.\nauthor:\n- |\n    Jiwei Li$^{{{\\bf 1}}}$, Will Monroe$^{{{\\bf 1}}}$, Tianlin Shi$^{{{\\bf 1}}}$, S\u00e9bastien Jean$^2$, Alan Ritter$^{{{\\bf 3}}}$ and Dan Jurafsky$^{{{\\bf 1}}}$\\\n    $^1$Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\\\n    $^2$New York University, NY, USA\\\n    $^3$Ohio State University, OH, USA\\\n    [jiweil,wmonroe4,tianlins,jurafsky@stanford.edu]{}\\\n    [sebastien@cs.nyu.edu]{}\\\n    [ritter.1492@osu.edu]{}\nbibliography:\n- 'emnlp2016.bib'\ntitle: Adversarial Learning for"

"---\nabstract: 'Understanding the mechanics behind the coordinated movement of mobile animal groups [(collective motion)]{} provides key insights into their biology and ecology, while also yielding algorithms for bio-inspired technologies and autonomous systems. It is becoming increasingly clear that many mobile animal groups are composed of heterogeneous individuals with differential levels and types of influence over group behaviors. The ability to infer this differential influence, or leadership, is critical to understanding group functioning in these collective animal systems. Due to the broad interpretation of leadership, many different measures and mathematical tools are used to describe and infer \u201cleadership\", e.g., position, causality, influence, information flow. But a key question remains: which, if any, of these concepts actually describes leadership?

In this paper we develop an anatomy of leadership, identify several principle components and provide a general mathematical framework for discussing leadership.

"---\nabstract: |\n    Interpretable machine learning has become a strong competitor for traditional black-box models. However, the possible loss of the predictive performance for gaining interpretability is often inevitable, putting practitioners in a dilemma of choosing between high accuracy (black-box models) and interpretability (interpretable models). In this work, we propose a novel framework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) that integrates an interpretable model with ***any*** black-box model to combine their strengths. The interpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where the black-box is overkill or nearly overkill, gaining transparency at no or low cost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model *transparency* (defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.) Under this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with association rules and the other with linear models, and we design customized training algorithms for both models. We test the hybrid models on structured data and text data where interpretable models collaborate with various state-of-the-art black-box models. Results show that hybrid models obtain an efficient trade-off between transparency and predictive performance, characterized by our proposed *efficient frontiers*.\n\n    interpretable machine"

Phase transitions, associated to deconfinement, restoration of chiral and axial U$_A$(1) symmetries are expected to occur at high density and /or temperature. A question that has attracted a lot of attention is whether these phase transitions take place simultaneously and which observables could signal its occurrence.\n\nThe U$_A$(1) symmetry is explicitly broken at the quantum level by the axial anomaly, that may be described at the semiclassical level by instantons, giving a mass to $\\eta'$ in the chiral limit, which implies that, in the real world, this meson is not a remnant of a Goldstone boson. The U$_A$(1) anomaly causes flavor mixing, which has the effect of lifting the degeneracy between several mesons. So, the effective restoration of this symmetry should have relevant consequences on the meson masses as well as on the phenomenology of meson mixing angles. In particular, the $\\eta'$ mass should decrease and this"

"---\nabstract: |\n    Performing model selection between Gibbs random fields is a very challenging task. Indeed, due to the Markovian dependence structure, the normalizing constant of the fields cannot be computed using standard analytical or numerical methods. Furthermore, such unobserved fields cannot be integrated out and the likelihood evaluztion is a doubly intractable problem. This forms a central issue to pick the model that best fits an observed data. We introduce a new approximate version of the *Bayesian Information Criterion*. We partition the lattice into continuous rectangular blocks and we approximate the probability measure of the hidden Gibbs field by the product of some Gibbs distributions over the blocks. On that basis, we estimate the likelihood and derive the *Block Likelihood Information Criterion* (BLIC) that answers model choice questions such as the selection of the dependency structure or the number of latent states. We study the performances of BLIC for those questions. In addition, we present a comparison with ABC algorithms to point out that the novel criterion offers a better trade-off between time efficiency and reliable results.\n\n    **Keywords:** Hidden Markov random fields; model selection; Bayesian Information Criterion\nauthor:\n- Julien Stoehr\n- 'Jean-Michel Marin[^1]'\n- Pierre Pudlo\ntitle: Hidden"

"---\nabstract: 'In computer vision, convolutional networks (CNNs) often adopts pooling to enlarge receptive field which has the advantage of low computational complexity. However, pooling can cause information loss and thus is detrimental to further operations such as features extraction and analysis. Recently, dilated filter has been proposed to trade off between receptive field size and efficiency. But the accompanying gridding effect can cause a sparse sampling of input images with checkerboard patterns. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-level wavelet CNN (MWCNN) model to achieve better trade-off between receptive field size and computational efficiency. The core idea is to embed wavelet transform into CNN architecture to reduce the resolution of feature maps while at the same time, increasing receptive field. Specifically, MWCNN for image restoration is based on U-Net architecture, and inverse wavelet transform (IWT) is deployed to reconstruct the high resolution (HR) feature maps. The proposed MWCNN can also be viewed as an improvement of dilated filter and a generalization of average pooling, and can be applied to not only image restoration tasks, but also any CNNs requiring a pooling operation.

"---\nabstract: 'Adaptation in a fluctuating environment is a process of fueling environmental information to gain fitness. Living systems have gradually developed strategies for adaptation from random and passive diversification of the phenotype to more proactive decision making, in which environmental information is sensed and exploited more actively and effectively. Understanding the fundamental relation between fitness and information is therefore crucial to clarify the limits and universal properties of adaptation. In this work, we elucidate the underlying stochastic and information-thermodynamic structure in this process, by deriving causal fluctuation relations (FRs) of fitness and information. Combined with a duality between phenotypic and environmental dynamics, the FRs reveal the limit of fitness gain, the relation of time reversibility with the achievability of the limit, and the possibility and condition for gaining excess fitness due to environmental fluctuation. The loss of fitness due to causal constraints and the limited capacity of real organisms is shown to be the difference between time-forward and time-backward path probabilities of phenotypic and environmental dynamics. Furthermore, the FRs generalize the concept of evolutionary stable state (ESS) for fluctuating environment by giving the probability that the optimal strategy on average can be invaded by a suboptimal one owing to"

If recent conjectures about false vacuum decay catalyzed by black hole evaporation apply, the lack of vacuum decay events in our past light cone may place new bounds on the black hole formation rate and thus on the fundamental scale of gravity in these models. For theories with fundamental scale $E_{*}$ above the Higgs instability scale of the Standard Model, we find a lower bound on $E_{*}$ that is within about an order of magnitude of the energy where the cosmic ray spectrum begins to show suppression from the GZK effect. Otherwise, the abundant formation of semiclassical black holes with short lifetimes would likely initiate vacuum decay.

Whereas classical DGS systems can be completely characterized, it was only possible to provide necessary or sufficient conditions for the quantum case. First, for all DGS systems the interaction between the dimers must be balanced in a certain sense. Moreover, one can identify four special classes of DGS systems: (i) Uniform pyramids, (ii) systems close to isolated dimer systems, (iii) classical DGS systems, and (iv), in the case of $s=1/2$, systems of two dimers satisfying four inequalities. Geometrically, the set of all DGS systems may be visualized as a convex cone in the linear space of all exchange constants.

"---\nabstract: 'In this paper, we study the problem of determining the size of battery storage used in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. In our setting, electricity is generated from PV and is used to supply the demand from loads. Excess electricity generated from the PV can be stored in a battery to be used later on, and electricity must be purchased from the electric grid if the PV generation and battery discharging cannot meet the demand. Due to the time-of-use electricity pricing, electricity can also be purchased from the grid when the price is low, and be sold back to the grid when the price is high. The objective is to minimize the cost associated with purchasing from (or selling back to) the electric grid and the battery capacity loss while at the same time satisfying the load and reducing the peak electricity purchase from the grid. Essentially, the objective function depends on the chosen battery size. We want to find a unique critical value (denoted as ${C_{\\textup{ref}}^{\\textup{c}}}$) of the battery size such that the total cost remains the same if the battery size is larger than or equal to ${C_{\\textup{ref}}^{\\textup{c}}}$, and the cost is strictly larger if the battery"
"---\nabstract: |\n    This work is motivated by a hand-collected data set from one of the largest Internet portals in Korea. This data set records the top 30 most frequently discussed stocks on its on-line message board. The frequencies are considered to measure the attention paid by investors to individual stocks. The empirical goal of the data analysis is to investigate the effect of this attention on trading behavior. For this purpose, we regress the (next day) returns and the (partially) observed ranks of frequencies. In the regression, the ranks are transformed into scores, for which purpose the identity or linear scores are commonly used. In this paper, we propose a new class of scores (a score function) that is based on the moments of order statistics of a pre-decided random variable. The new score function, denoted by D-rank, is shown to be asymptotically optimal to maximize the correlation between the response and score, when the pre-decided random variable and true covariate are in the same location-scale family. In addition, the least-squares estimator using the D-rank consistently estimates the true correlation between the response and the covariate, and asymptotically approaches the normal distribution.

The computation in MBQC is driven by adaptive measurements executed in a particular order on a large entangled state. In contrast in HQC the system starts in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian which is slowly changed such that a transformation occurs within the subspace. Following the approach of Bacon and Flammia, we show that any measurement-based quantum computation on a graph state with *gflow* can be converted into an adiabatically driven holonomic computation, which we call *adiabatic graph-state quantum computation* (AGQC). We then investigate how properties of AGQC relate to the properties of MBQC, such as computational depth.

After a general analysis of the symmetry conditions for vanishing gap functions, we study the case of chiral $p$- and chiral $f$-wave pairing on a square lattice, a situation relevant for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Specifically, we calculate the impurity-induced density of states, specific heat, superfluid density and thermal conductivity employing a self-consistent T-matrix calculation and compare our results to the case of a nodal ($d$-wave) order parameter. While there is a clear distinction between a fully gapped chiral state and a nodal state, the strongly anisotropic case is almost indistinguishable from the nodal case. Our findings illustrate the difficulty of interpreting thermodynamic measurements. In particular, we find that the available measurements are consistent with a chiral ($f$-wave) order parameter.

Research in this field has been motivated partly by new experimental techniques (for example with cold atoms [@cold-atom-review]) where an almost perfect isolation from the environment can be achieved, and therefore equilibration induced by the system itself can be studied.\n\nEquilibration in a quantum mechanical system means that the expectation values of physical observables approach stationary values in the long time limit.

The former lead to low computational time but require the selection of a regularization parameter, whose value significantly impacts the achieved solution, and whose automated selection remains an involved and challenging problem. Conversely, fully Bayesian formalisms encapsulate the regularization parameter selection into hierarchical models, at the price of high computational costs. This contribution proposes an operational strategy that combines hierarchical Bayesian and Potts model formulations, with the double aim of automatically tuning the regularization parameter and of maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed procedure relies on formally connecting a Bayesian framework to a $\\ell_2$-Potts functional.

Comparing, in the grand canonical ensemble, the free energies of the hairy and undressed black holes two different phase transitions are found. The first of them is one of second-order type and it occurs at a temperature defined by the value of the cosmological constant. Below this temperature an undressed black hole spontaneously acquires a scalar hair. The other phase transition is one of first-order type. The corresponding critical temperature, which is bounded from above by the one of the previous case, strongly depends on the coupling constant of the quartic self-interaction potential, and this transition only appears when the coupling constant is less than a certain value.

The focused wave amplitude is exactly the sum of the focusing soliton heights; the maximum wave inherits the polarity of the fastest soliton in the train. The focusing of several solitary waves or/and breathers may naturally occur in a soliton gas and will lead to rogue-wave-type dynamics; hence it represents a new nonlinear mechanism of rogue wave generation.

"---\nabstract: 'Over the last two decades, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has become one of the most important ways to investigate the structure of crystal surfaces. STM has helped achieve remarkable successes in surface science such as finding the atomic structure of Si(111) and Si(001). For high-index Si surfaces the information about the local density of states obtained by scanning does not translate directly into knowledge about the positions of atoms at the surface. A commonly accepted strategy for identifying the atomic structure is to propose several possible models and analyze their corresponding [*simulated*]{} STM images for a match with the experimental ones. However, the number of good candidates for the lowest-energy structure is very large for high-index surfaces, and heuristic approaches are not likely to cover all the relevant structural models. In this article, we take the view that finding the atomic structure of a surface is a problem of stochastic optimization, and we address it as such. We design a general technique for predicting the reconstruction of silicon surfaces with arbitrary orientation, which is based on parallel-tempering Monte Carlo simulations combined with an exponential cooling.

The magnetic field provides an additional pressure that can prevent the growth of a given perturbation; however, the magnetic pressure is confined only to the plane orthogonal the field. As a result, the \u201cJeans length\u201d of the system not only depends on the wavelength of the fluctuation but also on its direction, and the perturbative evolution is anisotropic. We derive this result analytically and back it up with direct numerical integration of the relevant ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations during the matter-dominated era.

In case of ground-based data of pulsating stars, this threshold is conventionally taken to be four times the mean noise level in an amplitude spectrum.

Our result clearly shows that a 95% confidence level, common for ground observations, can be reached at 5.4 times the mean noise level and is coverage dependent.

Robustness of distant speech recognition in adverse acoustic conditions, on the other hand, remains a crucial open issue for future applications of human-machine interaction. To this end, several advances in speech enhancement, acoustic scene analysis as well as acoustic modeling, have recently contributed to improve the state-of-the-art in the field. One of the most effective approaches to derive a robust acoustic modeling is based on using contaminated speech, which proved helpful in reducing the acoustic mismatch between training and testing conditions.\n\n    In this paper, we revise this classical approach in the context of modern DNN-HMM systems, and propose the adoption of three methods, namely, asymmetric context windowing, close-talk based supervision, and close-talk based pre-training. The experimental results, obtained using both real and simulated data, show a significant advantage in using these three methods, overall providing a 15% error rate reduction compared to the baseline systems.

Its position on the sky makes it a convenient target for both northern and southern telescopes, and, as a result, this star has a very rich observational history. $\\zeta$ Tau has some distinctive features that make it an important laboratory for testing theoretical ideas about processes associated with the Be phenomenon. First, it has a circumstellar (CS) disc that has shown little or no secular evolution in the past 18 years or so (@ste09, hereafter Paper I; @riv06). Second, it shows a very stable $V/R$[^1] cycle, with a quasi-period of about 1430 days [Paper I; @ste07].]{}]{} [[ In Paper I, a compilation of spectroscopic, spectrophotometric, polarimetric and spectropolarimetric observations of $\\zeta$ Tau was presented, covering 3 complete"

Compared to their (2,2) cousins, (0,2) nonlinear sigma models are poorly understood. There has been a renewed recent interest in them, see for example [@Guffin]. This paper aims to provide a concrete tool for various calculations in the theories. We focus our attention on the quintic case, but most of our techniques are applicable in a much wider context.\n\nLet us review the basics of the vertex algebra approach to mirror symmetry. In the"

"---\nabstract: 'We construct electrically charged Kerr black holes (BHs) with scalar hair. Firstly, we take an uncharged scalar field, interacting with the electromagnetic field only indirectly, via the background metric. The corresponding family of solutions, dubbed Kerr-Newman BHs with ungauged scalar hair, reduces to (a sub-family of) Kerr-Newman BHs in the limit of vanishing scalar hair and to uncharged rotating boson stars in the limit of vanishing horizon. It adds one extra parameter to the uncharged solutions: the total electric charge. This leading electromagnetic multipole moment is unaffected by the scalar hair and can be computed by using Gauss\u2019s law on any closed 2-surface surrounding (a spatial section of) the event horizon. By contrast, the first sub-leading electromagnetic multipole \u2013 the magnetic dipole moment \u2013, gets suppressed by the scalar hair, such that the gyromagnetic ratio is always smaller than the Kerr-Newman value ($g=2$). Secondly, we consider a gauged scalar field and obtain a family of Kerr-Newman BHs with gauged scalar hair. The electrically charged scalar field now stores a part of the total electric charge, which can only be computed by applying Gauss\u2019 law at spatial infinity and introduces a new solitonic limit \u2013 electrically charged rotating boson"
