"\nFlipkart Raises $160M From Dragoneer Investment, Morgan Stanley Investment - dotmanish\nhttp://www.medianama.com/2013/10/223-flipkart-160m-investment/\n======\narihant\nThere are two points people miss in discussions around FLipkart:\n\n1.) Flipkart in India is about access, not just convenience. Even with large\nbookstores like Landmark, Crossword, etc. all over the city, not every book s\navailable all the time. Say I want to buy a Swiss army knife from a small city\n- Flipkart is where I go!\n\n2.) The \u20b9500 minimum order requirement is a bit of a pain. But Flipkart\nusually still works out cheaper. Firstly, not many things apart from books\nwould be available for less than 500. And books on Flipkart are massively\ndiscounted. I bought a book last week for \u20b9450, with a markup of \u20b9795. I\ngladly paid the shipping and got it next day morning!\n\nAnybody who is complaining about Flipkart should really try it. One day free\nshipping halfway across the country is just crazy! No other e-com site does\nthat. Amazon doesn't provide that fast shipping for free either! And most\nother e-com sites in the country are only about Fashion and Clothing, while\nAmazon India is just a better looking ebay.\n\n~~~\nenscr\nFlipkart is"

The\nlatter category is where Groupon fits in, and I don't think it has the same\nstigma as the former, nor do I think the recession will affect it as much.\n\nFlashing your iPhone to save 60% on"

"\nDesigning Schemaless, Uber Engineering\u2019s Scalable Datastore Using MySQL (2016) - mangatmodi\nhttps://eng.uber.com/schemaless-part-one/\n======\ndcposch\nFYI, MySQL has a fresh new JSON data type now.\n\nIt has some great properties. It lets you mix data with a strict schema and\ndata without a strict schema, getting some of the benefits of both worlds.\n\nThe JSON datatype avoids many of the annoying legacy considerations that other\nSQL column types have. You don't have to specify a length--so you won't make a\nVARCHAR(255), then get burned when one day a value has more than 255\ncharacters. You don't have specify a character encoding--JSON is always\nutf8mb4, the right one. (MySQL's 'utf8' encoding, perversely, supports only a\nsubset of utf8 and will break if you try to write an emoji.)\n\nHere's a table that illustrates some of the power:\n\n    \n    \n      create table unitType (\n        id bigint not null auto_increment,\n        buildingId bigint not null,\n      \n        info json,\n        name varchar(255) as (info->>'$.name') not null,\n      \n        primary key(id),\n        foreign key (buildingId) references building(id) on delete cascade,\n        unique key(buildingId, name)\n      );\n    \n\nWe're modeling unit types in a building.

Once you are too busy to do both, than hire for whichever side you\ncan find the best suited person. e.g. programmer or lead nurturer.

That is a reason\n\"shared_ptr\" in C++, and its analog in Rust, are used sparingly, particularly\nin libraries that might need to be used nobody-knows-where.

When you control the main\nprogram, you can take all kinds of liberties. But a language that doesn't\nsupport using the full power of the language to write universally-usable\nlibraries will always remain in whichever ghetto birthed it.\n\nAnother problem not noted in the article is the often very poor cache locality\nbehavior of GC-dependent languages.

They just published their\nfirst app (a calculator) on the app stores and we looked inside to see if\nthere was anything too surprising.

A family of blue jays (or\nmost birds in the Crow [Corvidae] family) will rapidly hoard whatever you give\nthem and finish off a large pile of peanuts within hours. Unlike other birds\nthat also visit the pile of peanuts I leave out, they have no intentions of\neating most of those peanuts as they take them and just stash them for later\n(similar to a squirrel).\n\nThe other problem is allocating peanuts to other birds (chickadees,\nnuthatches, cardinals, etc) while not giving too many to the blue jays.\nHowever, there's a project I ran across from CalTech that can determine the\ntype of bird in front of a camera via computer vision[1][2][3]. Not sure why\nthe creator of the squirrel project used a camera though when a cheaper, more\nrobust sensor would work unless he was eventually thinking of extending its\nusage for more than simple motion detection.\n\n[1]\n[http://vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/20q.html](http://vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/20q.html)\n\n[2]\n[http://vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/ipadapp.html](http://vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/ipadapp.html)\n\n[3] [https://github.com/welinder/cubam](https://github.com/welinder/cubam)\n\n~~~\nulf\nCreator here, I used a camera so that"

What\nbothers me here is that there's no articulation of that standard, just a\nrejection of the idea that a public statement is sufficient.\n\nTo make it more concrete: let's say that Facebook ended all of the practices\nthe author objects to, but told no one. Clearly the author would not endorse\nFacebook.\n\nTaking that a step further, the author clearly is not convinced by Facebook's\npublic statements. So if Facebook"

"\nWhy do programmers prefer Python over Ruby? - daviddavis\nI'm a Ruby programmer. Recently there was a poll about everyone's favorite programming language and Python came out ahead over Ruby. To me, Python seems to lack some of the niceties that Ruby has like blocks and it also seems to have some superfluous stuff like having to pass self into each method.

That language is the one used by almost every branch of\nscience and engineering to precisely describe and reason about the objects\nthey study: the language of mathematics.

I suppose projects like Node/io.js need as\nmany contributors as they can get, so anything that lowers the barriers to\nentry for new contributors is a good thing.\n\nWith regards to the language mentioned below: the English is very good, albeit\na bit terse. I think the main issue is that the article tries to cover a lot\nof ground in such a short time. My advice for @indutny is to narrow the focus\na bit and pick a clear structure for the article, with an introduction and a\nconclusion.\n\n~~~\nindutny\nThank you for the kind words.\n\nIt is quite terse indeed, mostly because it was written as a basis for my 30\nminutes talk on JSConf Budapest. I guess, I'm going to eventually cover this\ntopic in a greater detail.\n\nThank you for advice!\n\n------\nniix\nI emailed Fedor awhile back about some tips on diving into C++ and he was\nnothing but an amazing help on resources and places to start looking.

I\nthink most developers do indeed talk to their users, and they rather enjoy\ndoing it, too. I've once worked in a place where developers are more detached\nfrom users, but that was an exception, not a norm.\n\nThere's also a difference between the opinion of one user vs the collective\nopinions of users as a whole. In most software these are conflicting goals.\nFor example, iOS can't just add random features willy-nilly to satisfy an\nindividual's feedback. So the product management needs to come in between\ndevelopers and users to aggregate user demands. You'll have to make everyone a\nlittle bit unhappy to make users collectively happier. One of the reasons I\nlike extensible software is that those two goals are no longer conflicting.\nHopefully you know what I mean when you see Jenkins ([http://jenkins-\nci.org/](http://jenkins-ci.org/))\n\nI do share the joy of \"caring about your users,\" there's something very\nspecial in knowing this one person/user, understanding his/her needs, solving\nit, and making him/her"

Worse, some have a strong metallic aftertaste that I don\u2019t appreciate. I started to search online for specialty jerky, but there are so many small and large brands!<p>I know that in addition to intellectual pursuits, plenty of people here are into alternative diets and food in general, and might know something about jerky. I\u2019d really appreciate and specific brands, or general tips to sort the wheat from the chaff.<p>Thanks very much if you\u2019ve read this far, and thanks again if you can help.\n======\nckrusk\nEPIC Bites and Snack Strips.

It's meritless and\nbaseless, but I assume it stems from my finding it frustrating that the courts\nallow a thing to continue _before_ they rule on its Constitutionality. It\nwould seem to me that stopping unconstitutional behavior by the executive\nbranch should be the most important thing before the court, and something that\nshould not drag out for a decade. So why _does_ the court allow a program that\nmay be violating millions of peoples' constitutional rights to continue, all\nthe while agreeing with and ruling in favor of government stall tactics?\n\nIt's amazing to me that the court _agreed_ with the executive that they had no\nright to judge on executive constitutionality!

As SpaceX have been launching their own since 2010.\n\nAlso interesting is the reasoning behind capturing parts of the rocket (and it\nis only parts) in midair.

"\nThe End of Rationalism: An Interview with John Ralston Saul (2001) - walterbell\nhttp://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/saul.html\n======\nmuraiki\nI find the author's discussion of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil a bit\nconfusing, precisely because the tree holds the knowledge of _good and evil_,\nnot the type of scientific knowledge the author seems to be discussing.\nForgive me for a bit of a rant, but I think that understanding how to\ninterpret this story actually helps make his point better.\n\nThe message isn't to be innocent of scientific knowledge -- it's to be\ninnocent of evil. And that evil is immediately made manifest not just in Eve\nblaming the snake, but perhaps more heinously by Adam blaming not only Eve but\nGod: \"The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I\nate\". Adam and Eve demonstrate a renunciation of self responsiblity and\nultimately, of the gift of free will that they have been given, for the sake\nof trying to falsely appear blameless. Contrast this with the new Adam,\nChrist, who takes the blame of others upon Himself (even though He is\nblameless) demonstrating not just His divinity but _what humanity truly"

"\nNew Adventures for Elm - shoover\nhttp://elm-lang.org/blog/new-adventures-for-elm\n======\njey\nI've been looking at the options for pure-functional languages targeting JS,\nand it seems that PureScript is superior to Elm from a technical perspective\nfor full-stack webdev. PureScript takes the approach of providing a full\nHaskell-like language that is \"native\" to the JS world. It has the features\nand type system of Haskell, but atop a cleaned up version of Javascript's\nsemantics (e.g. strict evaluation, not lazy, by default). It's also well\nsuited for both server and client code, and even has a C++11 backend in the\nworks in addition to the native JS backend.\n\nIn contrast, Elm is focused on front-end work and is less expressive, but\nemphasizes simplicity. Elm's goal of figuring out how to simplify and distill\nthe Haskell and ML world's abstractions is an admirable one, but as an\nexperienced programmer interested in practical work I'd rather just go with\nPureScript and just learn the Haskell-like abstractions along the way. It also\nreally helps that the PureScript compiler's javascript output is \"natural\" and\neasy to understand, without any mysterious transformations involved.\n\nHave others looked at PureScript, Elm, Haste, GHCJS, etc and chosen\ndifferently?\n\n~~~\nrlander\nWell, \"superior\""

But hopefully, I'm not\ngoing to do the same with the current project.\n\nTaggy is a desktop application for fast saving texts, links or images using\nonly shortcuts. With Taggy you don't need to copy-paste anything or even open\nan application. Everything you need to do is copy whatever you want to save\n(any text, link or image) and press a special shortcut for saving. That's it,\neasy huh?\n\nAnd after you finish working, reading or whatever you were doing, you can open\nan application, open tab 'Unsorted' and sort everything how you want - you\ndon't have to worry about it while you are focusing on something else.\n\nLet me know what you think about Taggy and how you think I can make it better\n:)"

Also, I could update for errata and new features and material.<p>I don\u2019t think I could make much money, but I am really excited about the idea, and I think it would be a lot of fun.<p>I have all of the art and text ready to go, but my programming experience is limited to some FORTRAN and Matlab for physics research years ago.<p>How difficult of a task am I looking at here to teach myself how to build the app and do it? I\u2019m considering teaching myself, but I have other projects in the works. If I were to pay someone to do it, what kind of time frame could I expect?<p>Any advice at"

Is it not a wonder that those kids who walk to the\nbeat of their own drum in school becomes successful and those who always\nfollowed the rules become great paper pushers? That's what school does, it\nteaches us to seek an approval that's external to us (ie. teacher's approval,\ngrades, awards) and not a sense of internal approval (ie. pride, enjoyment,\nsatisfaction). We all get at least nearly 2 decades of this socialization\nprocess to be pounded into a mold (whether we're round, or rectangle or\nrhombus, we're all going into that square hole, because that's the only way to\nsucceed in school, and if we don't, we're deemed a freak and forced to be\nmedicated and the like).

"\nAsk HN: Using consumer cellphones for an IoT network? - smattiso\nI have been looking into LoRaWAN for a low cost waterproof asset tracker I am looking at building.\nAFAIK, the primary benefits of LoraWAN over say LTE-M or cellular are: no connectivity costs and  potentially lower power consumption.<p>What I&#x27;m wondering is: why can&#x27;t we use our own cellphones as the &quot;base station&quot; that the IOT device talks with?

Bandwidths ie radio\nspectrum frequency allocations, including LTE are licensed/managed by\nrespective governments.
