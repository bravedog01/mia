"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nPlants have developed various mechanisms to protect themselves against different stresses whether abiotic or biotic. One of them is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (O~2~^\u2212^), singlet oxygen (^1^O~2~), and hydrogen peroxide (H~2~O~2~). Membrane-localized NADPH oxidases (Noxes) are the major source of ROS production in plants and transfer electrons from cytosolic NADPH/NADH to apoplastic oxygen which leads to ROS. They are the homolog of the mammalian NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit known as gp91phox \\[[@CR1]\\]. Unlike animals, plant NADPH oxidase consists of two major structural elements: Respiratory burst oxidase homologue (Rboh) and Rop (Rho-like protein; a Rac homologue of plants). The first plant NADPH oxidase was identified in *Oryza sativa,* known as *OsRbohA* \\[[@CR2]\\] and subsequently, more Rbohs were discovered in other plant species including dicots, monocots and lower plants \\[[@CR1]\\]. Rboh proteins contain two Ca^2+^-binding EF-hand motifs in the N-terminal region, six transmembrane helices, FAD and NADPH binding domains in the C-terminal. The currently available crystal structure of OsRbohB N-terminal region (138--313 amino acid residues) has indicated the presence of two additional EF-hand-like motifs (EF-like 1 and EF-like 2) \\[[@CR3]\\]. Rbohs are known to perform versatile functions in the plant reproduction, growth, development,"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nFebrile urinary tract infections (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis and prostatitis, are relatively common in adults, but data on the optimal duration of treatment are limited, especially within men, the elderly and patients with comorbidities. Emerging bacterial resistance calls for more efficient efforts to shorten the duration of antibiotic treatment.\n\nOur previous findings in the FUTIRST trial have shown that patients with community-acquired febrile urinary tract infections, such as women and elderly patients with severe comorbidities, can be safely and efficaciously treated with oral ciprofloxacin for 7\u2009days, irrespective of disease severity upon presentation \\[[@CR1]\\]. In men, however, a short course of therapy can lead to significantly more clinical failures compared to a 14-day course of oral ciprofloxacin.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that procalcitonin (PCT) can provide useful guidance for antimicrobial treatment in patients with respiratory tract infections and sepsis \\[[@CR2]--[@CR4]\\]. However, little is known concerning PCT guided-therapy in patients with urinary tract infections. An earlier subgroup analysis of a randomized trial performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) has shown that the duration of antibiotic treatment was significantly shorter for 24 UTI-patients receiving procalcitonin-guided treatment compared to 18 UTI control-group patients \\[[@CR4]\\]. However further investigations are scarce."
"Background\n==========\n\nThe occurrence of cerebral ischemic stroke is influenced by eating habits, environment, genetic factors and so on. Fundamentally, genetic factors involve in a series of key enzymes and receptors on many metabolic pathways. Therefore, the study of the genetic risk factor for cerebral ischemic stroke has become a hot spot currently.\n\nCytochrome P450(CYP) 2C19 is a very important drug metabolizing enzyme, which involves in approximately 2% of the clinical drug metabolism. The activity of CYP2C19 enzyme not only exhibits a significant ethnic heterogeneity, but also has an obvious differences between individuals. It is believed that the differences are mainly caused by genetic variations. Many researchers have investigated the molecular mechanism of CYP2C19 enzyme polymorphisms, which include the wild-type CYP2C19\\*1, CYP2C19\\*2, CYP2C19\\*3, CYP2C19\\*4, CYP2C19\\*5, CYP2C19\\*6, CYP2C19\\*7, CYP2C19\\*8, etc. CYP2C19\\*2 and CYP2C19\\*3 are the main variants in CYP2C19, while others are relatively rare in humans.\n\nStudies have shown that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP2C19\\*2(CYP2C19 G681A, rs4244285) and CYP2C19\\*3(CYP2C19 G636A, rs4986893) may increase the incidence of cardiovascular events \\[[@B1]-[@B3]\\]. Whereas there are less research about the relationship between SNPs in CYP2C19 and cerebral ischemic stroke. So we carried out a case-control study to investigate the relationship between the distribution"

"We appreciate the thorough commentary by Drs. Franks and Nettleton ([@bib1]). The major finding of our paper ([@bib2]) was that interaction between the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1 (*CDKAL1*) gene and total energy intake (TEI) affected hemoglobin A~1c~ levels in apparently healthy Japanese men. Given the limited space in which to respond to Franks and Nettleton, we will focus on a few of the more pertinent issues.\n\nFirst, we are aware of the limitations of our study, including its low statistical power due to the small sample size, and we agree with Franks and Nettleton regarding the consequences of a low-powered study in general. These consequences can only be overcome by selecting a larger cohort. Thus, our paper is, at best, an exploratory analysis rather than a validation analysis of the effect of a well-studied *CDKAL1* polymorphism.\n\nFranks and Nettleton raised a question with regard to the accuracy of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used for measuring TEI. We agree that assessing the validity of the dietary intake method is essential.

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nIt is almost canon that the human hippocampus is necessary for some types of memory and relational reasoning, and that hippocampal dysfunction produces anterograde amnesia ([@R1]--[@R7]). However, three recent reports highlight major challenges to dominant theories of hippocampal function. First, anatomical study of the famous amnesic patient H.M., whose memory loss is usually attributed to hippocampal damage ([@R5]), found that more of his hippocampus was spared and histologically intact than was previously reported ([@R8]) (H.M.'s spared volume: left = 2.02 cm^3^, right = 1.96 cm^3^; age-matched intact hippocampus volume: 3.04 cm^3^). Instead of selective hippocampal damage, the histological examination confirmed previously observed ([@R9]) widespread damage to other temporal lobe structures such as the entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex, a focal orbital frontal lesion, atrophy of the mammillary bodies and thalamus, and greater loss of white matter integrity than was normal for a man his age ([@R8], [@R10]). Second, the previously reported selective hippocampal damage in developmental amnesic patients ([@R6]) was recently found to be accompanied by mammillary body and anterior thalamus damage ([@R11]). The extent of this nonhippocampal damage correlated better with memory loss than did the hippocampal damage. Third, formation of new memories in the object-in-scene task,"

The prevalence of IBS ranges between 7% and 21% depending on the country and criteria used, and it has an adverse effect on the patient's quality of life \\[[@R02]\\]. Four IBS subtypes are suggested by the Rome IV criteria based on stool form: diarrhea predominant IBS (IBS-D), constipation predominant IBS (IBS-C), mixed IBS and unclassified IBS (IBS-M) \\[[@R03]\\]. IBS-D is considered the most common subtype with a prevalence of 40-60% of all IBS \\[[@R04], [@R05]\\].

"Introduction {#cobi12545-sec-0030}\n============\n\nAnthropogenic landscapes, and the ecosystem services and benefits they provide, are dynamic in both time and space and driven by factors such as human demography, urbanization, climate, and land\u2010use. Understanding these dynamics is important for designing effective conservation and land management strategies that take account of the variety of benefits humans derive from such landscapes and the trade\u2010offs associated with different management strategies (Anderson et\u00a0al.

"Old Drivers in a New Context {#sec0005}\n============================\n\nThirty years ago this year, in 1988, the enzyme phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) was identified as a signal transducer downstream of activated cell surface growth factor receptors [@bib0005]. Its initial identification in the context of a viral oncogene immediately implicated the PI3K pathway in cancer, and we now know that the genes encoding the p110\u03b1 catalytic PI3K subunit and its negative regulator, phosphatase and tensin homolog (*PTEN*), are among the most commonly mutated in solid tumors. It has long been known that heterozygous mutations in *PTEN* are also responsible for rare, cancer-prone syndromes collectively known as **PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome** (**PHTS**; see [Glossary](#glo0005){ref-type=\"glossary\"}) [@bib0010].

"1. Introduction {#sec0001}\n===============\n\nThe unicellular parasitic eukaryotes of the family Trypanosomatidae are the cause of many major human diseases including African trypanosomiasis and New World leishmaniasis ([@bib0018]). Those of the genus *Leishmania*, transmitted to humans by the bite of a sandfly, affect around 4 million individuals globally ([@bib0017]). A prominent cause of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Americas, *L. mexicana* are a popular focus of recent research owing to their complete development cycle being observable *in vitro* ([@bib0002]). In the highly motile promastigote stage of their life cycle, a stage defined by morphology and as shown in [Fig.\u00a01](#fig0001){ref-type=\"fig\"}, they utilise a single flagellum for locomotion, protruding from their anterior cell body and predominantly beating with a tip-to-base planar wave, the latter being common to all Trypanosomatidae ([@bib0007], [@bib0014], [@bib0015], [@bib0019], [@bib0020], [@bib0028]). Their viability in the sandfly vector midgut is thought to depend upon their ability to navigate effectively ([@bib0010]), with it being widely accepted that their survival in the low-Reynolds number environment of the sandfly midgut is reliant upon attachment to the nearby epithelium ([@bib0004], [@bib0011]).

"Three-dimensional structures of proteins provide important insights into their biological function. NMR spectroscopy is the sole approach for determining 3D structures of proteins in solution under near physiological conditions. In addition, NMR spectroscopy enables investigations of protein conformation and dynamics under different conditions. Whereas, structure determination from single-crystal X-ray diffraction has been largely automated, protein structure determination from NMR data still can require skilled manual intervention. This is particularly true for proteins that are large (\\>12\u00a0kDa), multimeric, or partially disordered. Most of the NMR-derived protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al. [@CR2]) represent monomeric proteins of fewer than 120 residues (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In addition, the number of NMR-derived structures is a small fraction of the total number of depositions (Supplementary Fig. S1B).\n\nWe have been developing an integrated approach to NMR-based protein structure determination that builds on *NMRFAM*-*SPARKY* (Lee et al.

Children with DS are born most often to families with no previous DS history.[@CIT0004]\n\nRecently the DS medical community has come together around the fact that adolescents and young adults with DS are at risk of significant functional regression as adolescents or young adults.[@CIT0005] When medical conditions, common to DS, such as seizures, infections, celiac, metabolic and cardiac diseases have been excluded, catatonia has emerged as the common diagnosis.[@CIT0006]--[@CIT0011] Though the three previous reports of catatonia occurring in DS indicate it is eminently treatable, prospective studies have been limited by the number of patients and the length of medical follow-up.[@CIT0006]--[@CIT0008] This has led to unease by physicians and families in the choice of treatments and even some concern about the legitimacy of the catatonia diagnosis in DS, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nThe purpose of this publication is"
"Gastric varices are a complication of portal hypertension ([@bibr1-2047981614555141],[@bibr2-2047981614555141]), but are less common than esophageal varices ([@bibr1-2047981614555141]). However, once gastric varices bleed the mortality rate without therapy is high, at 45--55% ([@bibr1-2047981614555141]), making quick management necessary. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) is considered an effective therapy for gastric varices ([@bibr3-2047981614555141],[@bibr4-2047981614555141]).\n\nThe presence of a gastro-renal shunt has been reported in almost all, that is, 97%, of advanced gastric varices as a complication of portal hypertension ([@bibr2-2047981614555141]). In the B-RTO procedure, the balloon catheter is usually inserted into the gastro-renal shunt from the inferior vena cava through the left renal vein to occlude the gastro-renal shunt after which sclerotic agents are injected into the gastric varix.\n\nRecently, we experienced a 10-year-old boy with a gastric varix occurring after long-term treatment by Kasai's hepatic portoenterostomy for biliary atresia with successful disappearance of jaundice. B-RTO was performed for this patient, but was not completely effective using the usual method employed. For this case, we finally succeeded by performing B-RTO while the splenic artery was transiently occluded with inflation of a balloon catheter.\n\nCase report {#sec1-2047981614555141}\n===========\n\nKasai's hepatic portoenterostomy procedure for biliary atresia was performed for this infant at the age of 69"
"Experiment 1: separate predictions\n==================================\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nHuman perception is currently understood as a complex and active process. This mainly relates to the fact that the processing of incoming information is heavily and already early biased by what we have experienced before. The current research investigates underlying mechanisms, involving knowledge stored as internal representations of the environment. The knowledge shapes the structuring of new information to infer its causes and leads to interpretations (perceptual inference); it also predicts outcomes of the currently experienced situation (den Ouden et al., [@B12]). The predictive principle can improve behavioral adaptation in this situation due to facilitation and speeding-up the processing (Bar, [@B4]; Bubic et al., [@B9]; Wacongne et al., [@B52a]; Arnal and Giraud, [@B3]; Clark, [@B10]). The internal representations work as generative models, i.e., they predict upcoming events on basis of experienced rules of the environment (Bar, [@B4]; Winkler et al., [@B58]; Bendixen et al., [@B5]; Clark, [@B10]). The predictive coding theory assumes that predictions of future events are sent to hierarchically lower levels to be matched with ascending information. Resulting prediction errors signal failed predictions. They are forwarded to the higher level to update the generative models for more accurate predictions (Mumford, [@B28];"

Macrodasyidans are elongate, vermiform animals counting about 280 species; as a rule they are hermaphroditic and inhabit sands of the marine environment. However, with regard to the environment, two notable exceptions exist: *Marinellina flagellata* Ruttner-Kolisko, 1955 and *Redudasys fornerise* Kisielewski, 1987. In fact, both species have been reported from freshwater habitats: an Austrian, alpine stream and a Brazilian, artificial reservoir, respectively [@pone.0031740-RuttnerKolisko1], [@pone.0031740-Kisielewski1]. The two species have been found only once and, due to the scanty nature of the original descriptions (especially true for *M. flagellata*), their phylogenetic alliances appear uncertain; as a consequence, *Marinellina* and *Redudasys* are currently systematised as *incertae sedis* [@pone.0031740-Hummon1]. We trust that surveys of new material, especially using modern methodologies of investigation, will provide new information that will clarify the taxonomic status of these enigmatic animals and hopefully explain the invasion of freshwater ecosystems by an originally marine taxon.\n\nAttempts to rediscover the European animals has in part failed, i.e., research in the type locality (i.e. river) has yielded no results (W.D.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal vulnerability to ischemic damage may pave the way to novel therapeutic strategies in cerebrovascular disorders. Transient cerebral global ischemia in experimental animal models or humans causes the degeneration of specific populations of vulnerable neurons, such as pyramidal neurons of the CA1 hippocampal subfield \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\]. Neurodegeneration develops slowly and becomes manifest only several hours following reperfusion \\[[@CR2]\\]. This relatively long temporal window facilitates the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying the delayed ischemic neuronal death, and allows the translation of these mechanisms into potential therapeutic targets. One of the most widely used animal models of transient global ischemia is the 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) model in rats \\[[@CR3]\\]. In rats subjected to 4-VO, CA1 pyramidal neurons tipically die at 48-72 h after reperfusion, whereas neurons of the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus are relatively spared, at least at this timepoint \\[[@CR4], [@CR5]\\]. The use of this model led to the identification of early molecular events occurring in neurons destined to die, such as derepression of the gene silencer, REST \\[[@CR6]\\], down-regulation of the Ca^2+^-impermeable AMPA receptor subunit, GluA2 \\[[@CR2], [@CR4], [@CR7]\\], activation of nuclear factor-\u03ba\u0392 (NF\u03ba\u0392) and cyclooxygenase-2 \\[[@CR8], [@CR9]\\], and induction"
"1. Introduction {#sec1-plants-09-00513}\n===============\n\nFlowering time is a crucial trait that determines plant regional adaptability to diverse environmental conditions, as well as the grain yield of cereal crops \\[[@B1-plants-09-00513],[@B2-plants-09-00513]\\]. In legume forage crops, flowering time also serves as an indicator for harvesting, as famers often cut legumes at the early bloom stage. It is important to elucidate flowering time-related genes and their regulation mechanism in alfalfa and other legumes. Flowering time is affected by numerous environmental and endogenous signals, via intricate molecular pathways \\[[@B3-plants-09-00513]\\]. The molecular mechanism underlying flowering time has been extensively studied in model plants, and genes regulate the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, mainly through photoperiod, vernalization, autonomous and gibberellin pathways \\[[@B1-plants-09-00513]\\]. Among them, *CCT* family members widely participate in the regulation of flowering time through photoperiod and vernalization pathways, and they also play vital roles in plant growth and development \\[[@B4-plants-09-00513],[@B5-plants-09-00513],[@B6-plants-09-00513]\\].\n\nThe *CCT* genes contain a CCT domain that originally corresponded to a 43-amino-acid sequence in the carboxy-terminus of three proteins in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, namely CO (CONSTANS), COL (CO-LIKE), and TOC1 (TIMING OF CAB1) \\[[@B7-plants-09-00513],[@B8-plants-09-00513],[@B9-plants-09-00513]\\].

"INTRODUCTION {#sec1-1}\n============\n\nAcanthosis nigricans (AN) is characterized by symmetric, hyperpigmented, velvety thickening of the skin predominantly over the flexors. The word AN (*acantho*, Greek for thorn and *nigricans*, Latin for becoming black) was first proposed by Unna in 1890.\\[[@ref1]\\] AN is usually benign in children, and the generalized form is very rare in this age group. Malignant AN secondary to an internal malignancy is seen over 40 years of age. It is of sudden onset and is rapidly progressive.

"Introduction\n============\n\nIn recent years, rice (*Oryza sativa* L.) utilization has diversified from simple consumption as a staple food to commercial, processing and animal feed uses. Reducing rice production costs is essential for producers because price differences between rice and the other grain crops such as wheat and corn influence whether rice is used for these other value-added applications. One of the most effective cost reduction measures is to increase yield through the development of high-yielding cultivars.\n\nOn the other hand, rice blast disease caused by the fungus *Magnaporthe grisea* is an important disease in rice and conferring blast resistance is among the most important aims for rice breeding. Blast resistance can be roughly classified into two types ([@b5-67_16099]): complete resistance (plants do not get infected at all) and partial resistance (plants can get infected although the severity is mild). Complete resistance to blast is controlled by a single gene and is very effective against a particular blast race; however, once a cultivar with a new complete resistance gene is introduced, blast races capable of overcoming the resistance occur and spread, with eventual loss of resistance ([@b2-67_16099]).

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nOver the past few decades, obesity is increasingly becoming a prevalent worldwide health problem in the human population. Currently, one-fifth of the women are obese at time of conception \\[[@CR1]\\]. Maternal overweight and obesity not only can cause pregnancy related complications such as gestational diabetes, hypertension and preeclampsia, but also establish a detrimental genetic, hormonal and biochemical environment for the developing embryo/fetus \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\]. Maternal pregestational-overweight is an independent factor linked with infant and adolescence overweight and abdominal obesity \\[[@CR4], [@CR5]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nMental imagery refers to the experience of perception in the absence of external sensory input, for example \"seeing in the mind's eye\" ([@B1]). Cognitive science suggests that mental imagery is more emotionally-evocative than its verbal-based counterpart ([@B2]). Emotional imagery symptoms feature across affective disorders ([@B3]--[@B6]). Clinical formulation in psychology suggests such mental imagery contributes to the disorder maintenance, and as such imagery presents opportunities for treatment innovation, especially for areas of considerable clinical challenge such as bipolar disorder/BD ([@B7]) and anhedonia in unipolar depression/UD ([@B8]). In psychopathology, adaptive positive imagery can also be promoted ([@B9]--[@B11]), and conversely, maladaptive negative imagery can be disrupted ([@B12]--[@B15]).\n\nImagery---in models of psychological treatments---has been primarily conceptualized as a maintenance (\"proximal\") factor, i.e., keeping the disorder going once it developed. Delineating the role of imagery throughout illness progression and outside of the illness episode can help map other areas of application that stand to gain from a focus on imagery. For example, emotional imagery abnormalities, which are (causal) risk factors proceeding disorder onset, might be addressed to prevent disorder emergence (i.e., primary prevention). Likewise, imagery abnormalities that persist in remission can serve as target for keeping the individual well and preventing relapse"

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nCritically ill patients suffer from multiple organ dysfunction mostly occurring in the course of ischemia/reperfusion or septic shock. In these conditions, overwhelming amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species are generated. ROS are oxidizing agents produced during mitochondrial respiration and phagocytosis. In addition, ROS cause post-translational modifications of proteins, modifying their action and affecting cellular signaling, gene expression, oxygen sensing and other physiological processes \\[[@CR1],[@CR2]\\]. In low concentrations, ROS also enhance the antioxidant response via nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 activation, and thereby promote cell survival \\[[@CR2]\\]. While ROS are crucial for body homeostasis and defense, they cause harm if abundant production overwhelms the antioxidant defense. In that case, ROS can induce reversible or irreversible injury to proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, thereby contributing to endothelial dysfunction, cellular injury and multiple organ dysfunction.\n\nEndothelial dysfunction is a uniform, ROS-mediated manifestation of ischemia/reperfusion and sepsis. Furthermore, ROS-induced damage to the glycocalyx, cellular membranes and junctions leads to increased permeability, adhesion of leukocytes and platelets with local activation of inflammation and coagulation, leads to loss of endothelial vasodilatation and attenuates the vascular response to vasoconstrictors \\[[@CR3]-[@CR6]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe foxtail genus, *Setaria* P. Beauv., so named by the presence of sterile bristles that subtend spikelets in a close panicle, belongs to the \"bristle clade\" (subtribe Cenchrinae, tribe Paniceae, subfamily Panicoideae) of the grass family Poaceae (Morrone et al., [@B126]). The genus has a labile morphology requiring additional characters for the resolution of phylogenetic relations among the 113 odd species of the genus (Clayton et al., [@B34] onwards). One of the species, the foxtail millet *Setaria italica* (L.) P. Beauv. has been cultivated along with other millets in dryland farming system since prehistoric times (Madella et al., [@B119]; Weisskopf and Lee, [@B222]). Some other species of the genus also serve as significant sources of forage and fodder (Aliscioni et al., [@B4]; Marinoni et al., [@B121]). Several studies have attempted to resolve the infrageneric (Stapf and Hubbard, [@B199]; Webster, [@B218]; Pensiero, [@B152]) and intergeneric (Webster, [@B219], [@B220]; Veldkamp, [@B213]; Morrone et al., [@B127]) relations of the genus. Molecular studies on the chloroplast gene ndhF have revealed polyphyletic nature of the genus with three well supported clades (Kellogg et al., [@B97]).

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nAlpha-satellite DNA is the major species of repetitive element found at the centromere of all normal primate chromosomes. It is organized in a hierarchical structure based on a \u223c171 bp monomeric unit that is tandemly multimerized into a higher-order repeat (HOR), which is itself repeated in tandem over hundreds to thousands of kilobases in the centromeric region of all normal human chromosomes \\[reviewed in ([@b1]--[@b3])\\]. Centromeric alpha-satellite acts to organize the recruitment of key centromeric proteins (CENPs) to form a trilaminar protein--DNA complex, the kinetochore, which mediates the interactions between the chromosome and the spindle apparatus that are responsible for coordinated chromosome movements during cell division ([@b4]--[@b6]). While functional kinetochores have been observed at chromosomal locations not containing any alpha-satellite \\[so-called 'neocentromeres'; reviewed in ([@b7])\\], only cloned alpha-satellite DNA has thus far been shown to form centromeres *de novo* when introduced into the cell nucleus by transfection or microinjection in artificial chromosome assays ([@b8]--[@b11]).\n\nThe ability to create human artificial chromosomes (HACs) was pioneered through the development of techniques to synthesize large alpha-satellite arrays *in vitro* ([@b12]).

In current clinical practice, clinico-pathological staging is used to identify patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant chemo-radiation pre-operatively and adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery \\[3}. However ^18^F-FDG PET is becoming an increasingly established imaging modality in colorectal cancer for staging and response assessment [@pone.0099567-Liebig1], [@pone.0099567-Chowdhury1].

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nThe mucosal epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) displays highly specialised functions, like the digestion and absorption of ingested food and elimination of undigested food, microorganisms, and microbial products. To protect the mucosa, the host produces a layer of mucus covering the stomach, small intestine and large bowel (Atuma et al. [@CR2]; Cone [@CR12]). This protective barrier, which constitutes the first line of defence against physical and chemical injury (Neutra and Forstner [@CR36]), consists of two adjacent layers: a thin inner layer, which is sterile and physically difficult to dislodge, and a thicker outer one, which is not sterile and more diffuse (Johansson et al. [@CR21], [@CR22]). The major components of mucus are mucins, which are responsible for its viscoelastic gel-like and biological properties. The membrane-bound and secreted mucins are large glycoproteins, with a protein backbone linked to a complex array of hydrophilic oligosaccharide side chains (Bansil and Turner [@CR3]), which represent potential ligands for microbial adhesins and/or an energy source for microorganisms in the outer mucus layer (McGuckin et al. [@CR32]). Biological and physical interactions with the mucus layer, and especially mucins, are increasingly identified as an important trait in improving the gut ecology through a"

In one of the largest studies to date of diabetes trends, the researchers of NCD-RisC said aging populations and rising levels of obesity across the world mean diabetes is becoming a defining issue for global public health. This study used data from 4.4 million adults in different world regions to estimate age-adjusted diabetes prevalence for 200 countries. It found that between 1980 and 2014 diabetes has become more common among men than women, and rates of diabetes rose significantly in many low- and middle-income countries, including China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt, and Mexico. While the alarming nature of the disease is as such, the inefficacy and inadequacy of current antidiabetic treatments in mitigating the disease condition have also been highlighted from studies such as the Link\u00f6ping Diabetes Complications Study \\[[@B2]\\], the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) Research Group \\[[@B3]--[@B5]\\], and the UK"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nMaternal outcomes following gestational diabetes {#Sec2}\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAround 700,000 women give birth in England and Wales each year; up to 5% of them have a diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy \\[[@CR1]\\]. Among women with diabetes in pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM; described as abnormal glucose tolerance which first develops or is recognised during pregnancy) constitutes around 85% of cases, with the remainder due to pre-existing type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). The aetiology of GDM is not completely known but is due in part to the inability of the maternal pancreas to secrete sufficient insulin to cope with pregnancy-induced insulin resistance in susceptible women. The incidence of GDM is on the rise, in part due to higher rates of obesity in the general population, including in women of childbearing age \\[[@CR2]--[@CR4]\\]. Estimates suggest that lifestyle factors such as obesity, smoking, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity may explain around 50% of the incidence of GDM \\[[@CR5]\\].\n\nA diagnosis of GDM is associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother and her affected offspring.

The incidence of localization of the tubercular bacilli in the gall bladder is uncommon as the intact gall bladder mucosa is resistant to the bacterium because of the concentrated bile acids present in the organ. The spread of infection to the gall bladder could be hematogenous, from an adjacent caseating lymph node or from the peritoneum.[@CIT1] Cholilithiasis or cystic duct obstructions are thought to be essential for the development of gall bladder tuberculosis.[@CIT1][@CIT2]\n\nA 26-year-old female presented to the surgical outpatient department with right upper on-and-off abdominal and epigastric pain with dyspepsia for 8 months.

"In the current issue of Frontiers in Immunology, Jean-Marie Andrieu and collaborators, report results from non-human primate experiments designed to explore a new vaccine concept aimed at inducing tolerance to the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) ([@B1]). This approach, which is significantly different from other vaccine concepts tested to date, resulted in a surprisingly high level of protection. If the results are confirmed and extended to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), this approach may represent a game changing strategy, which should be welcomed by a field that has been marred by mostly disappointing results.\n\nWhen HIV was discovered and established as the cause of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in 1983--1984, there was an expectation that a preventive vaccine would be rapidly developed ([@B2]).\n\nVaccines against several major human viral diseases (polio, measles, mumps, rubella, etc.) were successfully developed during the preceding two or three decades, mostly using live-attenuated viruses, and designed to induce the same type of protective immune responses that develop after natural infection.

"One of the main transformations of medical practice in the last quarter of a century is the meteoric growth of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The name of this new movement, may sound like a provocation, since it implies that before the advent of EBM in the 1980s medical decisions, especially those related to therapy, were not based on sound evidence. However, from the mid-nineteenth century, doctors repeatedly claimed that medicine had became a scientific discipline, a claim reiterated and reinforced in the twentieth century. Moreover, the main tool employed by EBM, the randomized controlled trial (RCT), is not a recent invention: it was developed in the 1940s, and became increasingly popular in the post-Second World War era, partly because regulatory agencies increasingly required that the efficacy of a new drug should be proved in an RCT, before issuing a marketing permit. On the other hand, the growing accumulation of results of controlled clinical trials did not seem to affect standards of routine clinical care. Left to their own devices, few doctors relied on the critical evaluation of RCT\\'s in their clinical decisions. Physicians continued to gather information in a haphazard way, to draw general conclusions from personal experience, and to listen"
"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nPartial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) is a congenital cardiovascular anomaly, which is characterized by abnormal connection of one or more, but not all, pulmonary veins (PVs) to systemic veins such as the superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC), and/or the right atrium (RA) \\[[@bib1]\\]. PAPVR arises from the failure of regression of primitive lung drainage when the pulmonary vascular bed and the common pulmonary vein from the left atrium (LA) establish a connection in the embryonic stage \\[[@bib2]\\]. In common types of PAPVR, anomalous PVs connect to those systemic veins and lack a normal connection to the LA.

"Introduction\n============\n\nThe diagnosis of small intestine diseases has been a challenge for a long time [@JR938-1] . However, with the development of new diagnostic tools, the evaluation and treatment of these conditions has become feasible [@JR938-1] [@JR938-2] . In this context, the carbon dioxide (CO ~2~ ) is the gas of choice for laparoscopic procedures because it is an inert gas, nonflammable, and highly diffusible. It also has rapid absorption and elimination, with minimal cardiopulmonary and acid-base effects on the organism.\n\nIn this sense, one can note the increasing use in endoscopic procedures with diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholagiopancreatography (ERCP), and enteroscopy [@JR938-3] [@JR938-4] . For enteroscopy procedures, where the execution time is longer and the volume of insufflated gas is high, the use of CO ~2~ is suggested based on advantages as larger intubation depth, lower abdominal distension and pain, generating more comfort to the patient, and lower dosage of sedatives when compared to the conventional use of ambient air to the insufflation of the intestinal lumen.\n\nTherefore, the small intestine can be adequately evaluated by enteroscopy regardless of the used technique (single balloon or double balloon), using CO ~2~ as the"

"1. Introduction {#sec0005}\n===============\n\nProtein kinase C (PKC) comprises a closely related family of serine/threonine protein kinases that were originally discovered by Nishizuka and colleagues in 1977 [@bib0005]. The PKC family consists of nine isotypes that are expressed in a wide range of cell types and tissues [@bib0010]. According to both the structures of the variable regulatory domains and the cofactor dependencies, PKCs are classified into the following categories: conventional PKCs (cPKCs; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), novel PKCs (nPKCs; \u025b, \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b7) and atypical PKCs (aPKCs; \u03b6, \u03b9) [@bib0015]. cPKCs require Ca^2+^ and diacylglycerol (DAG) for activation; however, nPKCs are Ca^2+^ independent and aPKCs do not require Ca^2+^ or DAG for their activation. In T cells, all isotypes except PKC\u03b3 are expressed. The expression of multiple PKC isotypes in a given cell suggests functional redundancy. Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry is focused upon the generation of low molecular weight inhibitors (LMWIs) that specifically inhibit selected PKC isotypes or combinations of multiple PKCs in order to suppress T cell-dependent immune responses that are concomitant with organ transplantation or autoimmune diseases [@bib0020; @bib0025].\n\nIn gene knockout experiments, two isotypes of PKC, PKC\u03b8 and PKC\u03b1, were shown to have physiological and non-redundant roles in"

The impact of the MHC in response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well recognized, with class I alleles like HLA-B\\*35:01 leading to rapid onset of AIDS while HLA-B\\*57:01 and HLA-B\\*27:05 confer long-term non-progression ([@bib9]; [@bib19]; [@bib21]). Various explanations for these associations have been suggested, including antigen presentation of a particularly effective peptide or of a number of peptides to cytotoxic CD8 T cells or recognition (primarily) independent of peptide by natural killer (NK) cells ([@bib9]; [@bib32]; [@bib29]; [@bib21]). Recently, the level of cell surface expression of HLA-C alleles correlated with CD8 T cell cytotoxicity has been proposed as one important basis for control ([@bib55]; [@bib5]).

This cognitive decline is aggravated by the onset or progression of cognitive impairment, such as dementia, and is most noticeable when it impacts active control of attentional resources that significantly affect everyday life tasks, including walking (Fernandez-Duque and Black, [@B12]; Sheridan and Hausdorff, [@B31]; Foley et al., [@B13]). This aggravation limits independent engagement in activities in later life, which often leads to decreased quality of life and increased individual and societal costs for healthcare.

"1. Introduction {#sec1-ijms-21-00771}\n===============\n\nEpigenetics refers to the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the nucleotide sequence. During plant growth and development, the chromatin structure in the nuclei must be precisely modulated in coordination with the transcriptional reprogramming associated with cell proliferation and cell fate determination within meristem regions. Nucleosomes, which are the basic structural and functional units of chromatin, comprise approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a globular histone octamer, each containing two molecules of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 \\[[@B1-ijms-21-00771]\\]. Nucleosomes are connected by a 20--200 bp DNA linker and form repeating structures that appear as \"beads-on-a-string\" in electron microscopy images. The nucleosome array is further compacted into a more condensed and highly heterogeneous structure, and the DNA dynamics are generally correlated with local chromatin accessibility. De-condensed or open chromatin regions are often associated with active transcription, whereas genes in a condensed chromatin structure tend to be transcriptionally inert \\[[@B2-ijms-21-00771],[@B3-ijms-21-00771]\\]. Nucleosome-depleted regions are usually detected in the promoters of highly transcribed genes rather than in the promoters of non-expressed genes or genes with low expression levels.

The Visual Functioning Index VF-14 was developed and validated by Steinberg and colleagues in the early nineties.[@ref4] The rationale for developing this index was the need for a tool that can accurately measure cataract surgery outcomes as visual acuity alone was considered as an insufficient measure.[@ref5][@ref6] Since its introduction, the VF-14 has been widely accepted and utilized for various ocular diseases that can affect vision including estimation of the need and urgency of cataract surgery. The VF-14 has been used to evaluate and compare different surgical procedures.

The main success criteria for the treatment are radiographic detection of apical closure of the root canal and absence of clinical signs and symptoms. One report has described the favourable clinical outcomes, resolving the infection and promoting root development of revascularization procedures ([@ref2]). The outcome was assessed by clinical evaluation, sensibility tests, and radiological images. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in applying the concept of tissue engineering in endodontics. Tissue engineering is the science of design and manufacture of new tissue to replace that which is impaired or damaged ([@ref3]). The key ingredients for tissue engineering are stem cells, morphogens, or growth factors that regulate their differentiation and a scaffold of extracellular matrix that constitutes the microenvironment for their growth ([@ref4]).\n\nThe use of a suitable scaffold is crucial in tissue engineering. A proper scaffold motivates cell attachment, proliferation, migration, and differentiation ([@ref5]). Scaffolds can be classified"

"Published: November 16, 2017\n\nIntroduction {#sec1}\n============\n\nAlzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is a common dementing disorder characterized by progressive decline of cognitive functions, especially memory loss. The neuropathology of AD includes extracellular deposits of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) in senile plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles comprising hyperphosphorylated tau, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death ([@bib6]). While most AD cases are sporadic late-onset type (LOAD), 1%--2% of the cases are of a familial early-onset type AD (EOAD), with underlying mutations in presenilin-1 and -2 (*PSEN1/2*) or\u00a0amyloid precursor protein (*APP*) genes ([@bib56]). Neuropathological changes and apparent cellular dysfunctions are similar in various forms of LOAD and EOAD, but the exact mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of AD are not well understood. According to the largely accepted amyloid cascade hypothesis, the extracellular accumulation of A\u03b2 peptides triggers the onset of AD ([@bib22]). Although considerable pre-clinical and clinical evidence supports the amyloid cascade model, all experimental therapies built on this hypothesis have thus far been unsuccessful in clinics ([@bib8], [@bib19]). Several\u00a0factors have probably contributed to the failures in AD drug development, including unsuitable pre-clinical research models, such as transgenic mice or human tumor-derived cell lines, which do not fully recapitulate the human disease.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nMigraine is a common and often disabling disorder affecting up to 20% of the general population, women 3--4 times more often than men [@pone.0022106-Haut1]. Clinically migraine presents with recurrent headache attacks and combinations of gastrointestinal and autonomic nervous system symptoms [@pone.0022106-Headache1], and up to one third of patients experience transient focal neurological symptoms known as migraine aura.\n\nMigraine pathophysiology is incompletely understood. While migraine is viewed as a primary disorder of the brain, vascular mechanisms are also implicated. For example, endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulability [@pone.0022106-Tietjen1] as well as altered vascular reactivity [@pone.0022106-Vanmolkot1] are found in migraine patients. In addition, the current evidence on the association between migraine and cardiovascular disease (CVD) was summarized in a recent meta-analysis [@pone.0022106-Schrks1], which found a two-fold increased risk for ischemic stroke among migraineurs, in particular those with migraine with aura. Some individual studies suggest that the link between migraine and CVD also extends to myocardial infarction (MI), CVD death, and hemorrhagic stroke [@pone.0022106-Kurth1], [@pone.0022106-Kurth2], [@pone.0022106-Kurth3], [@pone.0022106-Hall1], [@pone.0022106-Sternfeld1], [@pone.0022106-Velentgas1], [@pone.0022106-Ahmed1], [@pone.0022106-Bigal1], [@pone.0022106-Gudmundsson1].\n\nFamily and twin studies have shown that genetic factors importantly contribute to the pathophysiology of both migraine and CVD.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nInorganic nitrogen (N) is the most limiting nutrient affecting the growth of forest trees. As N uptake is influenced by soil water availability [@pone.0056421-Lower1], [@pone.0056421-Quaye1], this problem is exacerbated by increasingly frequent episodes of drought in many regions of the world due to ongoing climate change [@pone.0056421-Solomon1]. In addition to the adverse effects on mineral nutrient uptake, drought causes oxidative stress in plants, including poplar [@pone.0056421-Marron1], [@pone.0056421-Lei1]. As such, the drought stress response is tightly coupled with the antioxidant defense system and cellular redox regulation [@pone.0056421-CruzdeCarvalho1].\n\nGlutamine synthetase (GS) plays a central role in assimilation of ammonium into amino acids and other reduced N compounds in plants. Consistent with the central importance of N metabolism in plant growth and development, hybrid poplar (*Populus tremula X alba*, INRA 717-1B4) expressing ectopically the pine glutamine synthetase gene (GS1a) exhibited several pleiotropic phenotypes of agronomic significance. These include increased growth [@pone.0056421-Gallardo1], [@pone.0056421-Jing1], increased nitrogen use efficiency [@pone.0056421-Man1], altered wood chemistry [@pone.0056421-Coleman1], and of particular relevance to the present investigation, enhanced tolerance to drought [@pone.0056421-elKhatib1].\n\nThe superoxide dismutases (SODs) constitute a first line of defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) [@pone.0056421-Alscher1].

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nThe large-scale acidification of fresh waters in Europe and North America has had profound impacts on the biota, including widespread species loss and catastrophic fish kills (e.g. Schindler [@CR52]), and these effects are now being manifested increasingly in other parts of the world undergoing rapid industrialisation, including China and India (Seip et al. [@CR54]; Alewell et al. [@CR1]). Freshwater organisms differ widely in their tolerance of acidity, which is therefore a powerful determinant of community structure and ecosystem processes (e.g. Sutcliffe and Carrick [@CR71]; Townsend et al. [@CR57]; Rosemond et al. [@CR51]). Over the past four decades research has documented decreased biodiversity (e.g. Hildrew and Ormerod [@CR17]; Woodward [@CR64]) and shifts in the relative abundances of species as pH declines (e.g. Flower and Battarbee [@CR10]; Townsend et al. [@CR57]; Rosemond et al. [@CR51]; Ledger and Hildrew [@CR30]; Battarbee et al. [@CR3]). Far less is known about the consequences of these community changes for species interactions within the food web (Hildrew and Townsend [@CR19]; Hildrew et al.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are the principal types of IBD. Along with differences in the pathologic features of UC and CD, inflammatory lesions caused by these diseases are differentially distributed in the GI tract. UC primarily involves the colon and rectum, while CD affects any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus \\[[@B1-pharmaceutics-11-00585]\\]. Although the exact molecular etiology remains to be elucidated, IBD is thought to be caused by the interaction of environmental and genetic factors, leading to excessive immune responses to host intestinal microflora and resulting in destructive inflammation \\[[@B2-pharmaceutics-11-00585],[@B3-pharmaceutics-11-00585]\\].\n\n5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalazine) is an anti-inflammatory drug used for the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with mild-to-moderate IBD.

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an attractive procedure for endoscopists because it provides a variety of treatment options and clinically dramatic results \\[[@CR1]\\]. However, because the techniques of ERCP are so diverse and complex, the process of learning them is very difficult and time-consuming \\[[@CR2]\\]. In addition, it is necessary to proceed very sophisticatedly and carefully because it can induce serious adverse events even during the basic procedures. Therefore, both patients and endoscopists are usually under great pressure when ERCP is being conducted. To minimize this burden, endoscopists should perform all techniques of ERCP in a highly skilled and well-educated state to prevent all procedural-related adverse events. Although there is no qualifying test for ERCP procedures, some criteria or proposed curriculum for evaluating the ability to perform ERCP have been suggested and referenced in the ERCP training \\[[@CR3]--[@CR5]\\]. However, under the mentorship program, both trainees and mentors are forced to undertake ERCP education with great burdens and limitations.\n\nFor these reasons, ERCP training models have been developed and applied in various ways for a long time.

After 6 months, he presented with poor inflow and outflow of PD fluid. A provisional diagnosis of omental wrapping of the Tenchkoff catheter was made. Owing to the poor nutritional status, high surgical risk, and the need for immediate functional CAPD access it was decided to adopt laproscopic exploration to establish the diagnosis. Intraoperatively, omental wrapping of the catheter was confirmed and the catheter was exteriorized through one of the laproscopic ports and the omental tissue was dissected out manually and the catheter was retuned back into the peritoneal cavity. The catheter was maneuvered into the iliac fossa and secured with help of sutures to prevent migration. Immediate small-volume exchanges were initiated successfully with free in- and out-flows.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nWe sleep every night after experiencing a variety of events and happenings during the day. Recent studies on neuronal activities during sleep have begun to elucidate the adaptive value of postbehavioral sleep. For example, accumulating evidence has shown that the hippocampus and neocortex actively undertake the reorganization of their neural circuitry during postbehavioral sleep (Buzsaki, [@B12]; Diekelmann and Born, [@B22]). In the rodent hippocampus, synchronized activities of CA1 pyramidal cells occur in association with sharp wave (SPW)/ripple events during postbehavioral rest and sleep periods (Buzsaki, [@B12]). These self-organized activities during rest and sleep represent the replay of place cell activities in the CA1 region based on memory traces stored in the CA3--CA1 regions of the hippocampus during the preceding behavioral stage (Wilson and McNaughton, [@B106]; Lee and Wilson, [@B53]; Foster and Wilson, [@B25]). The SPW/ripple-associated replay activities of hippocampal neurons are thought to play an important role in spatial and episodic memory consolidation and concomitant reorganization of neuronal circuitry not only in the hippocampus but also in the neocortex, the target of hippocampal SPW/ripple activities (Buzsaki, [@B12]; Hasselmo, [@B32]).\n\nRecent studies have shown that neuronal circuitries in the central olfactory system are reorganized during postbehavioral rest and"

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nGrain boundary (GB) migration is a prevalent plastic deformation mode in nanocrystalline^[@CR1]--[@CR4]^ and polycrystalline^[@CR5],[@CR6]^ materials, and a comprehensive understanding of GB migration is vital to the development of novel materials through GB engineering. Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have been conducted to understand the underlying GB migration mechanisms^[@CR7]--[@CR10]^, and several shear-coupled GB migration models have been proposed correspondingly, including the displacement shift complete (DSC) dislocation model^[@CR11],[@CR12]^, Cahn model^[@CR13],[@CR14]^, pure shuffling model^[@CR15],[@CR16]^ and shear migration geometrical model^[@CR17],[@CR18]^. The DSC model^[@CR11],[@CR12]^ suggests that GB migration is a result of the lateral motion of DSC dislocations (also termed as disconnections) on the boundary plane. The Cahn model^[@CR13],[@CR14]^, extended from Read and Shockley's pioneer description of low-angle GB motion^[@CR19]^, predicts\u2009\\<\u2009100\u2009\\>\u2009and\u2009\\<\u2009110\u2009\\>\u2009branches of coupling for \\[001\\] tilt GBs according to the slip directions of GB dislocations. The pure shuffling model^[@CR15],[@CR16]^ proposes that the migration of high angle GB is mainly mediated by the local conservative shuffling of atoms at pure steps or ledges with no shear displacement.

"1. Introduction {#s0005}\n===============\n\nClinical laboratories have increasingly adopted next generation sequencing (NGS) as a standard for the diagnosis of hereditary disorders. Depending upon the specific focus of the diagnostic laboratory, NGS methods can be used to detect either germline or somatic mutations \\[[@bb0010]\\]. Through the use of PCR-based or hybridization-based enrichment strategies, laboratories may focus their clinical analysis on a single gene, multi-gene panels, or all known protein coding genes (exome sequencing) \\[[@bb0105]\\]. Since single gene tests and multi-gene panels tend to be the first step in genetic diagnosis of specific clinical diseases. The validity and utility of NGS-based panel testing has been demonstrated for a wide range of conditions including: hearing loss, vision loss, cardiovascular disorders, renal disorders, neurologic disorders, and cancer predispositions \\[[@bb0015], [@bb0020], [@bb0025],[@bb0045],[@bb0080]\\].\n\nCurrent short-read based NGS methods have important diagnostic limitations including sequencing of GC-rich sequences, repetitive sequences, and sequences that share high homology with other genes or pseudogenes.

For example, a recent estimation indicated that lung, stomach, breast and prostate cancer increased between 2001 and 2015 in Isfahan Provenience in the centre of Iran ([@A4076REF3]). Due to increased number of cancer patients and limited resources, like many other developing countries, more attention has been paid to quantitative and physical criteria like increasing cancer patients' survival or decreasing patients' mortality rate ([@A4076REF4]). However, having cancer appears to be like a catastrophic experience that may have an impact on all aspects of individuals' lives and their quality of life (QoL) rather than only physical issues ([@A4076REF5]).\n\nQoL is a concept used to emphasise that different aspects of individuals' lives such as physical, psychological, and emotional are important in determining the experience of living and its quality and need to be taken into consideration by health care professionals when caring for those whose life is under threat ([@A4076REF6]).

"The long-term complications that result from poor glycemic control contribute substantially to the morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of diabetes. Over time, the hyperglycemia seen in patients with diabetes can increase the risk of both microvascular complications and result in a two- to fourfold increase in the risk of macrovascular complications ([@B1]--[@B3]). The relationship between macrovascular complications and glycated hemoglobin is not understood precisely; however, atherosclerosis and vascular occlusion from hypercoagulability and increased adhesion of platelets are thought to occur through various metabolic mechanisms, placing individuals with diabetes at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease ([@B4]).\n\nAlthough near normoglycemic control has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of microvascular complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, the independent effect of A1C lowering on the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes is less clear ([@B5]--[@B7]). Although observational studies have described the naturalistic association between hyperglycemia and increased cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes, the results of interventional randomized controlled trials in establishing the cardiovascular benefit of pharmacotherapeutic management of hyperglycemia, including intensive therapy, have been inconsistent.

Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression and a broad program of brown-fat-like development.

"**Dear Editor**,\n\n*Klebsiella pneumoniae* (KP) is an important opportunistic pathogen causing community-acquired and nosocomial infections. When the host is immunocompromised, the pathogen would infect the host and cause diseases, such as pneumoniae, sepsis, liver abscess, meningitis, urinary tract inflammation and wound infection (Karaiskos et al., [@CR4]; Park et al., [@CR9]). The phenomenon that *K. pneumoniae* has a preference to infect immunocompromised populations, especially seniors suggests that the outcomes of *K. pneumoniae* infection depend on the pathogen-host interactions, but up to now, the molecular mechanisms underlying *K. pneumoniae*-host interactions remain largely unknown.\n\nPrevious studies reported that *K. pneumoniae* suppresses inflammatory cytokine production during early period of infection (Lawlor et al., [@CR5]), and this bacteria can block the activation of inflammatory responses by antagonizing NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways (Frank et al., [@CR16]; Regueiro et al., [@CR11]). We discovered that the *K. pneumoniae* nucleoid-associated protein (NdpA) is highly conserved among gram-negative bacteria.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nInflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) is a group of complex, chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders with unknown etiology, including Crohn's Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD patients suffer from recurrent or chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding, anemia and weight loss. Additionally, a spectrum of extraintestinal manifestations, such as joint inflammation, skin and eye manifestations or primary sclerosing cholangitis, may be associated with these diseases. Conventional therapies (*e.g.* aminosalicylates, antibiotics, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants) as well as biologicals (*e.g.* anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and anti-integrin antibodies) are available to treat CD and UC. However, side effects of these treatments are often severe and loss of response over time is common [@pone.0073703-Taylor1], [@pone.0073703-Nielsen1], indicating an urgent need for developing novel strategies to treat IBD.\n\nAlthough the pathogenesis of IBD is not completely understood, a well-accepted hypothesis is that dysregulation of the mucosal immune response against normal intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals contributes to the development of the disease [@pone.0073703-Gersemann1], [@pone.0073703-Siegmund1].

Although the effect of fibers on static properties such as modulus and strength is well understood, it has been a challenge to understand the effect of fibers on the viscoelastic properties of short-fiber composites. These properties are extremely important in load bearing applications where there is the potential for creep or stress relaxation, or where the composites are exposed to any sort of dynamic loading, and hence it is important to be able to predict the influence of fiber reinforcement on the viscoelasticity. Composite viscoelasticity can also influence fatigue behavior \\[[@B1-materials-10-00472]\\], and the temperature dependence of various mechanical properties, including creep resistance \\[[@B2-materials-10-00472]\\].\n\nStress relaxation experiments, in which a specimen is strained to a fixed level and the slow decay of stress is monitored, present a simple method of investigating the time-dependent modulus of reinforced polymers.

Treatment options for hearing loss typically depend on the severity of the hearing loss. Cochlear implants (CI) have long been a treatment option for individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss; however, with advancements in technology, candidacy criteria have expanded to include individuals with greater amounts of residual hearing. With this trend, the focus has shifted toward developing techniques and technology to allow for the preservation of residual hearing, as this has been shown to be important in obtaining optimal outcomes through the use of electric-acoustic stimulation. That is, in patients who receive CIs but maintain some useable residual hearing, the implanted ear can be stimulated using the ipsilateral combination of electric (CI) and acoustic (hearing aid)^[@CR2],[@CR3]^.\n\nIn attempts to achieve preservation of residual hearing, implementation of electrocochleography (ECochG) at the time of CI surgery has recently been described.

England\\'s NHS Cervical Screening Programme was the first in the United Kingdom to launch a new protocol of HPV triage in April 2011 ([@bib6]). Women with borderline or mild dyskaryosis will be routinely tested for HPV, and triaged according to the results ([Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}; [@bib29]). High-risk human papillomavirus test-positive women will be fast-tracked to colposcopy, replacing usual practice of cytological surveillance at six monthly intervals. HPV test-negative women, deemed low risk for cervical cancer, will return to routine age-sensitive screening rather than cytological surveillance ([Figure 1](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}; [@bib29]; [@bib31]).

Among HIV-positive individuals in China, a disproportionately greater number are rural residents and rural-to-urban migrants (Hesketh et al., [@CIT0005]; Xiao et al., [@CIT0015]). Many married men at the reproductive age have migrated to work in the city and left their spouses at home (Zhang, Chow, Jahn, Kraemer, & Wilson, [@CIT0017]).

From a neurocognitive perspective, HD is a highly interesting disorder as it has a clearly defined, single genetic mutation in the form of an expanded CAG repeat in the *HTT* gene, which predicts with certainty that the disease will develop in an individual. The effects of this mutation on neurobiology have been the subject of intense study with notable progress, although many questions still remain. Indeed, no clinical phase 3 trial to date has been successful for a drug that slows or reverses progression of HD, raising the question of whether the most efficient drug development methods are being leveraged \\[[@pone.0148409.ref001]\\]. A central requirement for success in clinical trials are objective and quantitative outcome measures that are sensitive to early-stage changes in presymptomatic individuals (pre-HD) as well as early stage manifest HD. Better clinical markers of disease progression could inform when to initiate treatment: too early would increase accumulation of negative side-effects, whereas too late could prevent successful therapeutic intervention."
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nIntravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is currently the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke patients presenting within 4.5\u2009h of symptom onset \\[[@CR1]\\]. However, approximately 30% of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with stroke-like symptoms are unfortunately stroke mimics \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\], posing a significant diagnostic challenge. Accurate diagnosis of ischemic stroke is critical, as IVT in stroke mimics may result in a small, but significant, life- threatening risk of intracerebral haemorrhage, without any benefit \\[[@CR4], [@CR5]\\].\n\nDespite the availability of a multitude of radiological investigations to exclude stroke mimics, the diagnosis of stroke remains a clinical challenge. Emergent use of non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head in patients with stroke-like symptoms is primarily to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage \\[[@CR1]\\] and not to confirm the presence of an ischemic stroke. Although NCCT head may identify early subtle signs of ischemic stroke, it is normal in majority of patients who present within the IVT time-window \\[[@CR6]\\], and does not help to radiologically confirm the diagnosis of ischemic stroke.

"Introduction\n============\n\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important tool for diagnosing, monitoring and evaluating risk in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD; [@B29]; [@B40]). ECG measurements, such as PR interval, QRS complex duration, and QT interval, are used for the diagnosis and prediction of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD; [@B24]). Myocardial depolarization and repolarization time are measured by the QT interval: the time between the onset of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave. QT shortening or prolongation has been associated with an increased risk for arrhythmias and SCD ([@B35]). PR interval and QRS duration are measures of cardiac conduction time; QRS duration reflects conduction through the ventricular myocardium, while PR interval measures atrial and atrioventricular conduction from the sinoatrial node to the ventricular myocardium, primarily through the atrioventricular node ([@B10]; [@B32]).\n\nThere are significant genetic contributions to ECG measurements; genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified at least 71 common variants associated with their variability ([@B4], [@B5]; [@B34], [@B33]; [@B41], [@B42]; [@B21]; [@B49]). A number of these associations were established in loci containing genes that encode proteins with previously known roles in heart development and function, such as cardiac transcription factors; sodium, calcium, and potassium ion channels;"
"Introduction {#sec1-1}\n============\n\nNeuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a heterogeneous group of tumors that can originate from all of the neuroendocrine cells in the body, mostly from the lung and gastrointestinal tract including stomach, pancreas, small and large intestine, rectum. They can occur at any age, although it is often seen over 50 years. The incidence of NET is higher in men than in women. Even though they usually exhibit indolent clinical course, they may become very aggressive and rapidly become metastatic. Since most of NET are not functional, they often cause no signs and symptoms, which makes early diagnosis difficult and decreases survival by reducing the chance of curative treatment (Yao et al., 2008). In addition to early diagnosis, streaming patients into appropriate prognostic groups is an important component of treatment. However, the absence of frequently accepted classifications limits its benefit on survival (Bilimoria et al., 2007).\n\nThere is insufficient information about the incidence and frequency of many NET subgroups, including those with unknown primaries. In addition, long-term follow-up and survival-related data are limited in NET patients. The survival and the factors affecting it in patients with NET in many countries have not been identified. This suggests that further studies"

Introduction\n================\n\nFollowing the demonstration of the causal relationship between microvascular complications and hyperglycaemia \\[[@b1-sensors-10-10936],[@b2-sensors-10-10936]\\], monitoring of glycaemic status is considered a cornerstone of diabetes care. During the past 40 years, technical advances have allowed for dramatic changes of monitoring of metabolic control. Before 1975, routine patient monitoring consisted of urine glucose and ketone determinations \\[[@b3-sensors-10-10936]\\]. Typically, physicians monitored occasional laboratory blood glucose determinations and reviewed patient home urine testing records. The primary purpose of monitoring was to provide information to the patient's health care provider to guide changes in therapy to relieve symptoms due to hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia and nocturia) rather than to achieve specific glycaemic goals. Since 1975, technical advances allowed for radical changes in glucose monitoring. In 1971 the first blood glucose monitor for point-of-care use in patients with diabetes was patented in the USA by Anton Clemens: the Ames Reflectance Meter. It was based on optical detection of a color change on glucose oxidase-based strips, and was succeeded by the Ames Eytone, which became commonplace in physicians' offices and hospitals. A number of clinical studies, in the late 1970s, demonstrated that the technology improved metabolic control and was applicable for self-management of patients in everyday"

"Why this topic?\n===============\n\nGrowing evidence from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies consistently indicates network abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients ([@R1],[@R2]). While a picture is emerging on how these changes affect cognition and behavior at various stages of the disease, there is less understanding of the changes in functional connectivity between spatially distant brain areas in the absence of a specific task, ie, in a \"resting state.\" Resting state fMRI focuses on spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in distant yet temporally synchronous brain areas, which presumably reflect neural connectivity ([@R3]-[@R5]). It has been hypothesized that low-frequency (0.1-0.01 Hz) fluctuations in the BOLD signal may be attributed not only to spontaneous neuronal activity detectable in the absence of cognitive task, but also to specific functional domains. In other words, these temporally correlated fluctuations can indentify brain networks ([@R6]). The existing evidence suggests alterations in several resting-state networks in AD, such as the default mode network ([@R7]-[@R9]), fronto-parietal network, executive network, salience network ([@R10]), and language network ([@R11]).\n\nResting state functional connectivity (RS FC) changes in the AD brain involve both decreased and increased connectivity within specific networks.

Many strains of *P. falciparum* have been isolated from different parts of the world and their phenotypes (e.g., drug susceptibility profiles, growth rates and transmissibility) investigated.

"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nThe Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP) or reductive acetyl-CoA pathway is the central pathway in acetogens and most strictly anaerobic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Although the WLP was investigated in depth the mechanism of energy conservation of most acetogens and AOB remained unclear since no net ATP is gained in this pathway by substrate level phosphorylation ([@B34]). For *Acetobacterium woodii*, the mechanism of energy conservation was elucidated completely ([@B7], [@B6]; [@B5]; [@B15]; [@B4]) and also the one in *Moorella thermoacetica* was studied in detail ([@B16]; [@B37]; [@B25]). *A. woodii* conserves energy with the help of a *Rhodobacter* nitrogen fixation (Rnf) complex which pumps sodium ions across the membrane while reduced ferredoxin (Fd^2--^) is oxidized with NAD^+^ in an exergonic reaction ([@B5]). Other modes of energy conservation were hypothesized before. The thermophile *M. thermoacetica* was shown to have a heterohexameric methylene-THF reductase (MTHFR) ([@B25]) which does not catalyze the reduction of methylene-THF with NADH. The genes for this enzyme are located in a cluster containing genes annotated as a heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr) enzyme complex.

However, there is growing recognition of the vital importance of cross-ecosystem fluxes of energy and materials between wet and dry ecosystems for their sustainable management ([@R2], [@R5]). A key exchange across the land--water interface that affects community structure and ecosystem function in temperate forested streams is the seasonal input of terrestrial coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) as deciduous leaves and wood ([@R28], [@R73], [@R88]).\n\nBecause of the hierarchical, branching structure of river networks, headwater tributaries typically represent much of the channel length in river networks ([@R40], [@R54]). Therefore, headwater tributaries are a dominant interface for the seasonal organic matter flux from upland forests to downstream waters, such as rivers, floodplains, lakes, and coastal waters. Headwater tributaries can have year-round or perennial flow, but across different regions, many headwater tributaries cease flowing for part of the year ([@R20]).

"1. Introduction {#sec1-molecules-24-02725}\n===============\n\nGlasses are amorphous materials lacking the periodic atomic arrangement typical for crystalline substances. Structurally, they resemble supercooled liquids but behave mechanically like solids. [Figure 1](#molecules-24-02725-f001){ref-type=\"fig\"} shows the specific volume or enthalpy as a function of temperature for a typical glass-forming liquid. Upon slow cooling from high temperatures, a liquid may crystallize at T~m~ forming a stable crystalline material. However, if the cooling through this temperature range is fast enough to avoid nucleation and subsequent crystal growth, a metastable supercooled liquid state is attained.\n\nWhen a supercooled liquid is cooled by a cooling rate of q^+^~1~ to lower temperatures, the internal molecular motion slows down and its viscosity significantly increases. At the glass transition temperature (T~g~), the time needed for molecular rearrangement becomes comparable to the experimental time scale. At a lower cooling rate (q^+^~2~ \\< q^+^~1~) the supercooled liquid stays in metastable equilibrium until lower temperatures. Therefore, the glass transition is not a true thermodynamic phase transition depending on procedural variables such as cooling rate.

About 600,000 tonnes of foundry waste are produced annually in Poland, including about 500,000 tonnes are waste from the iron foundry. Foundry waste, especially SFS, can be reused, e.g. in foundry production, in the construction and road industry. In addition, the use of SFS as a soil substitute is popular in the US and other countries (Dungan et al. [@CR20]; Dayton et al. [@CR15]). Foundry dusts can also be reused, e.g. in the production process of castings, in construction or to fill closed mines and excavations as inert material (Bo\u017cym and D\u0105browska [@CR11]; Bo\u017cym [@CR9]). The ability to reuse foundry dust depends on the composition and content of the contaminants. Dust is collected at various stages of casting production, e.g. while smelting metal in furnaces, cleaning casting and during SFS regeneration. Electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) is usually collected in a baghouse"

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nEuarthropods are the most diverse and successful animal phylum ever to have lived on Earth. One of the key innovations that contributes to their evolutionary success is the integration of different appendages, together with the associated segments, into the head region, often to facilitate sensory (e.g. the antenna(e) of Mandibulata) and feeding activities (e.g. the chelicerae and pedipalps of most chelicerates, the maxillae and mandibles of Mandibulata, the forcipules of centipedes and maxillipeds of various crustaceans). However, the exact evolutionary history of these anatomical innovations remains obscure, causing an 'endless dispute' on the homology of head segments within and between euarthropods and their relatives, the onychophorans and tardigrades \\[[@CR1]\\]. This dispute is difficult to settle because the morphologies of head segments and appendages are often highly modified or specialized, and as a result, there are no concordant criteria for recognising the head of Panarthropoda sensu Nielsen, 1995 \\[[@CR2]\\], i.e., euarthropods, onychophorans and tardigrades \\[[@CR3], [@CR4]\\].

Therefore, VF testing is important for understanding the degree of VF impairment. The VF is usually tested with static or dynamic perimetry. In static perimetry, results are directly fed from an automated perimeter into a computer, enabling objective examination and analyses. Dynamic perimetry is performed using a Goldmann perimeter (GP), which provides results that are drawn on an examination sheet. These are then subjectively evaluated by a perimetry specialist. Dynamic perimetry has the limitations of requiring a specialist to interpret test results and it only provides qualitative VF information.

No active bleeding was found at the time of colonoscopy. We inspected the diverticula one-by-one using water immersion to dilate the diverticula ([@B1]). The diverticula were evaluated by next-generation narrow-band imaging (NBI), which provides superior visibility to white light (WL) observation ([@B2]). On inspection, we encountered a suspicious site with protrusion under WL observation ([Picture 2](#g002){ref-type=\"fig\"}). NBI verified that this was an exposed vessel penetrating the bottom of the diverticulum by eliminating fuzziness and clearly demarcating the vessel from the surrounding mucosa via improved brightness and color contrast ([Picture 3](#g003){ref-type=\"fig\"}). Protrusion into the endoscopically ligated diverticulum was also confirmed ([Picture 4](#g004){ref-type=\"fig\"}).

". Introduction {#s01}\n==============\n\nEsophageal cancer (EC), the eighth most frequent malignant disease and the sixth most prevalent cause of disease associated deaths worldwide, had an estimated 456,000 new cases and 400,000 deaths in 2012 ([@b1]). EC prognosis is strongly associated with the stage at diagnosis. Most of the patients diagnosed with EC tend towards the locally advanced stage and the 5-year survival rate is very low (less than 20%). However, for early stage (stage I\u2212II) patients, the survival rate could be up to 85% ([@b2],[@b3]). Additionally, surgical resection, chemoradiation or other optimal therapeutic approaches depend on accurate preoperative staging ([@b4]). Therefore, accurate preoperative staging is important for predicting prognosis and choosing a suitable therapeutic strategy for patients with EC.\n\nIn clinical practice, computed tomography (CT) is universally used for preoperative diagnostics and remains the mainstay for preoperative staging of EC. However, because of poor contrast resolution of the esophageal wall, it is difficult to distinguish the different histologic layers in CT. CT is mainly used to evaluate regional spread into the adjacent organization (T4) and distant metastases (M1) ([@b5]-[@b7]). Recently, the study of radiomics has become a hot field. Radiomics, a noninvasive, quantitative and low-cost approach, can objectively and"

On the basis of this model, one would envision early, high-risk lesions to possess a limited amount of molecular alterations, with lesions further down the histologic spectrum (such as ductal carcinoma in situ \\[DCIS\\]) showing disproportionally higher rates of mutational change. In contrast to this prevailing notion, several recent studies have found a plethora of molecular changes, such as loss of heterozygosity, miRNA, and gene aberrations in normal tissues immediately adjacent to areas of breast carcinoma \\[[@B2-cancers-12-00722],[@B3-cancers-12-00722],[@B4-cancers-12-00722],[@B5-cancers-12-00722]\\].

However, clinical presentations are heterogeneous making the diagnosis challenging. To standardise the diagnosis, the major and minor diagnostic criteria were proposed in 2003 \\[[@CR5]\\] but despite this POEMS remains diagnostically elusive.

Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment with appropriate antimalarial drugs are critical for reducing the malaria burden. Because of the widespread resistance of *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria parasite species to chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP), the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended quality-assured artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for uncomplicated *falciparum* malaria since 2005 ([@B2]).\n\nParasite-based diagnosis is desirable before use of ACT because over-prescription of ACT, which is much more expensive than using conventional drugs, is a great threat to cost-effective intervention. Moreover, parasitological diagnosis can reduce the risk of adverse drug reactions as well as unnecessary drug pressure to malaria parasites. In most remote rural health facilities in malaria-endemic regions, however, microscopic diagnosis is limited, and malaria diagnosis has traditionally relied much on the history of fever and symptom-based diagnosis. Rapid diagnosis test (RDT) for malaria, therefore, enables accurate diagnosis in rural settings because it is easy to use, not time-consuming, and does not require electricity unlike microscopic examination ([@B3]). Consequently, in 2010, WHO changed the policy from clinical diagnosis to parasitological diagnosis,"

Networks formed by several sensors have been extensively applied to body monitoring with a myriad of applications, ranging from fall detection to cardiovascular monitoring and gesture detection \\[[@B3-sensors-19-04635]\\]. A fundamental issue when dealing with multiple sensors is how to combine them; some sensors can be imprecise due to noise or even incorrect due to the failure of the sensor. In some scenarios, sensors can generate redundant and/or highly correlated data, which can be a challenge itself, but it is also an opportunity to handle the noise of missing data. Furthermore, in the near future, the cheap availability of electronic components will allow for the strategy of using several sensors to measure the same physiological parameter, with the purpose of fusing the information coming from all of them to obtain higher quality information.

It has been estimated that approximately 230,000 women will be diagnosed with BC and 40,000 will die of the disease this year [@pone.0102341-Siegel1].\n\nAlthough targeted treatments have been developed for tumors that express the estrogen and progesterone receptors or overexpress the ErbB2 protein, these tumors typically develop resistance to currently used treatments. Furthermore, tumors that fail to express any of these proteins, which are classified as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), have no approved targeted therapeutics. Thus, for both relapsed tumors and TNBCs, the only recourse for treatment is broad spectrum chemotherapy, resulting in debilitating and sometimes persistent side effects.\n\nA recent study using a mathematical model to study cancer treatments and remission indicated that concurrent treatment with two or three different targeted therapies is more likely to induce long-term remission than single or sequential therapies [@pone.0102341-Bozic1].

"Introduction\n============\n\nGlycogen is the only storage form of carbohydrate in mammals. Its concentration in the brain is relatively low compared to that found in the most glycogenic tissues, namely liver and skeletal muscle. Within the brain, glycogen is stored mainly in astrocytes ([@B7]), although neurons also contain a small but functionally important amount ([@B29]). Brain glycogen is crucial for neuronal survival and synaptic activity during stress episodes such as hypoglycemia and ischemia ([@B39]; [@B37]), but also in euglycemic conditions during periods of increased brain activity ([@B35]; [@B5]). In this regard, regions of high synaptic activity contain greater glycogen stores ([@B30]). Astrocytes need glycogen-derived energy to sustain neuronal function by regulating the concentration of neurotransmitters and ions in the synaptic cleft ([@B43]; [@B40]). Thus, inhibition of glycogenolysis raises extracellular glutamate concentrations ([@B31]). In addition, several reports propose that astrocytes metabolize glycogen to lactate, which is then supplied to neurons for oxidative metabolism, in what is known as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis ([@B26]). Accordingly, glycogen-derived lactate has been shown to be important for memory formation ([@B38]). Therefore, astrocytic glycogen plays a key role in supporting neurotransmission. We previously described electrophysiological alterations and impairment of memory formation in a mouse model"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nTinnitus is the perception of one or more sounds despite the physical absence of such sound(s) (Chan, [@B9]). This condition is chronically experienced by a large portion of the population (\\>15%) and severely debilitating for about 1--2% of the population, affecting sleep, concentration, and productivity at work (Dobie, [@B13]; Heller, [@B26]). Tinnitus is associated with a higher risk of receiving disability pension (Friberg et al., [@B17]) and perceived as an enormous socioeconomic burden (Cederroth et al., [@B8]). In the Netherlands, tinnitus-related costs have been estimated to be \u20ac 6.8 billion per year (Maes et al., [@B37]). The prevalence of tinnitus is age-dependent, peaking in the seventh decade of life (Nondahl et al., [@B42]; Gopinath et al., [@B18],[@B19]; Shargorodsky et al., [@B46]; Park B. et al., [@B43]; Park K. H. et al., [@B44]). Tinnitus remains a clinical enigma because of the lack of effective treatments for stopping phantom tinnitus perception (Chan, [@B9]). Presently, tinnitus assessment relies on self-report questionnaires and subjective psychoacoustic measures (Langguth et al., [@B34]). Tinnitus heterogeneity varies in its phenotypes and may be objective (emitted by the ear itself and perceivable by an external observer) or subjective (only perceived by the patient), chronic or occasional,"
"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nIn technological practice, removal of nitrogen is most often accomplished using autotrophic nitrification followed by heterotrophic denitrification. For the removal of nitrogen, reactors containing activated sludge, biofilm, or granular sludge are employed. The latter type of biomass structure possesses many desirable properties such as short sedimentation time, high microorganism concentration, good solid--liquid separation, and resistance to high concentrations of organic and toxic compounds (Liu and Tay [@CR18]). From an engineering perspective, the installations employing technologies based on aerobic granular sludge require a smaller surface area and clarifier dimensions, shorter standstill for settling, and a longer time for the biological removal of pollutants. The self-immobilization that takes place during granule formation prevents slowly growing bacteria, e.g., nitrifiers, from being washed out from the system.\n\nSupernatants from sludge digesters, landfill leachate, and industrial wastewater treated by anaerobic fermentation are characterized by a high ammonia concentration and a low organics-to-total nitrogen ratio (COD/N). These wastewater types are most often treated together with municipal wastewater introduced to the main stream of a technological system that degrades the C/N ratio in the influent, thus negatively affecting the removal of nitrogen (Head and Oleszkiewicz [@CR13]).

The covalent addition of complex glycans to the amide side chain of asparagine (*N*-glycosylation) and hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine (*O*-glycosylation) generates a large number of glycoforms that are credited for the modulation of diverse cellular functions ([@B4], [@B5], [@B9]--[@B11]).\n\nProteins that undergo *N*-linked glycosylation are biosynthesized on membrane-associated ribosomes and their signal peptide is removed by a signal peptidase as they emerge into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

The selective recognition by OT of the consensus sequence (NXS/T) has enabled investigation of the structural requirements for *N*-glycosylation.

However, like most low molecular weight drugs, matrine is able to freely traverse in and out of blood vessels to distribute to non-tumor tissues, resulting in accumulation in the liver, spleen or kidneys, diminishing its effects on cancer cells. In addition, consistent with the results of other research groups, our previous study also showed that matrine had fewer side-effects and broader indications compared with conventional anti-cancer drugs. However, its anti-tumor activity was moderate, and its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was about 2.01mM [@B6].\n\nIn order to improve the tumor-specificity and efficacy of anti-tumor drugs, liposomes have been used extensively as delivery systems in both pre-clinical and clinical applications.

This commonly results in Wallerian degeneration (Conforti et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2019), first discovered by Waller (1851). The discovery of WLDS protein in strains of mice resistant to axonal degeneration (Mack et al., 2001; Coleman and Freeman, 2010; Williams et al., 2017) convinced researchers that Wallerian degeneration is a programmed cell event (Gerdts et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018). In normal mice, immediately after peripheral nerves suffer trauma, Wallerian degeneration begins (Girouard et al., 2018); the disintegration of axonal structures occurs (Geden and Deshmukh, 2016; Simon et al., 2016), atrophy of fiber tracts is observed and macrophages and Schwann cells infiltrate (Liou et al., 2011; Simon et al., 2016; Zigmond and Echevarria, 2019).\n\nIn the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells wrap around the nerve fibers and secrete neurotrophins to protect and nourish the peripheral nerves (Kennedy and Zochodne, 2005; Jortner, 2019). During Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells play a vital role in the degeneration and regeneration of neurons (Jessen and Arthur-Farraj, 2019; Jessen and Mirsky, 2019; Shefa and Jung, 2019; Yi et al., 2019).

"Since 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1 has caused massive outbreaks of HPAI in Asian countries \\[[@r17]\\]. During this time, H5N6, further HPAI viruses of the H5 subtype, and H7N7 have epizootically appeared in East Asia \\[[@r16]\\]. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries in Japan (MAFF) recommended that farmers enforce biosecurity measures on their farms. However, it has been difficult to keep the HPAI virus out, and 12 HPAI outbreaks involving H5N6 occurred at poultry farms in 2016--2017 \\[[@r13]\\].

The design of feedback controllers to control biochemical processes has received significant attention in the literature (see. e.g. [@bib0110], [@bib0005]), and the construction of synthetic control circuits has become a major focus of research in the new field of synthetic biology. Ideally, such circuits should be made up of well-defined modules consisting only of molecular reactions, in order to allow the realisation of embedded biomolecular control systems ([@bib0040]). A promising approach to facilitating the design of such circuits is provided by nucleic acid-based chemistry, wherein the design of biomolecular circuits can be done using abstract chemical reaction network (CRN) theory (e.g. [@bib0170]), and then translated to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) using strand displacement reactions for implementations ([@bib0035]).

"Despite its 400-year history, light microscopy continues to be the most common tool in biomedicine[@b1]. Between the two most important characteristics of a microscopic image: *resolution* and *contrast*, it is improving the latter that has driven most of the technology development in the light microscopy field. Once Abbe described in 1873 *diffraction* as the ultimate limit of the far-field optical resolution, researchers focused mostly on approaching this theoretical limit rather than exceeding it[@b2]. This dogma remained unchallenged until the 1990's when the nonlinear optical interaction with the sample proved to be a feasible approach for breaking the diffraction limit with far-field optics[@b3].\n\n*Contrast*, on the other hand, has not been proven to be bound by a universal physical law. Unlike the resolution, which is a property entirely of the optical system, the contrast depends on both the instrument and the object of interest (see, e.g., vol. 2 in ref. [@b4]). The main challenge identified early on was to generate images of appreciable contrast when the specimen of interest is transparent.

"Angiotensin-II is involved in hypertension\n==========================================\n\nAngiotensin-(Ang) II is the key peptide of the Renin--Angiotensin--Aldosterone System (RAAS). This system consists mainly of an enzymatic cascade catalyzed by renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), generating Ang II (Peach, [@B58]; Griendling et al., [@B26]). The effect of Ang II is mediated by Ang II receptors. Two isoforms of the Ang II receptor have been identified: type 1 receptor (AT~1~R) and type 2 receptor (AT~2~R).\n\nAng II and its receptors have multiple systemic and local actions in different tissues, including blood vessels, kidneys, adrenal glands, heart and central nervous system (CNS) (Sadjadi et al., [@B64]; Campos, [@B13]; Campos et al., [@B14]). For instance, in the vasculature, activation of AT~1~R induces potent vasoconstriction (Ito et al., [@B35]; Oliverio et al., [@B54]). In the adrenal glands, their activation stimulates the release of aldosterone that in turn promotes sodium reabsorption in the mineralocorticoid-responsive segments of the distal nephron (Masilamani et al., [@B46]). In the kidneys, activation of AT~1~R is associated with renal vasoconstriction and antinatriuresis (Navar et al., [@B48]). Furthermore, AT~1~R is involved in the progression of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure (Stegbauer and Coffman, [@B66]; Ichiki et al., [@B33]).\n\nAdditionally,"

Nevertheless, drug resistance invariably develops in the majority of the patients receiving MAPKi. Several reports showed that more than half of the resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy are due to genomic alterations, already present at baseline, which cause reactivation of the MAPK pathway \\[[@B1-cancers-12-00946],[@B2-cancers-12-00946]\\]. Thus, definition of the mutational profile of the melanoma before treatment initiation could be useful to identify the patients who might benefit from targeted therapy. Metastatic melanoma is one of the cancers with the highest mutational burden. Mutations in the promoter region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERTprom), along with mutations in BRAF/NRAS, are the most frequent genetic alterations detected in melanoma \\[[@B3-cancers-12-00946]\\].

In the literature, it has been described as traumatic pneumatoceles, traumatic lung cysts, pulmonary cavitations, cavitating haematoma, and traumatic pulmonary pseudocysts \\[[@B1]--[@B7]\\]. TP is characterized by the appearance of pulmonary cavities with no epithelial lining filled with air, fluid or, blood seen on radiology imaging, which usually resolve without surgery.

"Background\n==========\n\nIn order to perform their functions, protein surfaces usually have to interact with each other. However, only accessible parts of a protein can act as binding sites \\[[@B1]\\]. Since proteins consist of polypeptide chains that fold into complex three-dimensional patterns, binding sites can be divided into two different types: 1. sites that follow the primary amino acid sequence as a continuous or linear interaction site. 2. discontinuous or non-linear binding sites, which are made up of short peptide fragments that are not adjacent in the sequence but are in spatial proximity as a result of folding. Non-linear binding sites predominate in both protein-protein interactions, and in protein binding of small compounds \\[[@B2]\\]. Their detection is challenging because conventional mapping techniques have limited capabilities \\[[@B3],[@B4]\\]. The increasing number of structurally-determined proteins often permits a structure-based automated approach to the design of peptide libraries that can mimick particular surface regions.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nEvery year, several hundred million people are infected with *P. falciparum*, the cause of the most severe form of malaria in humans, and a significant fraction of infected individuals die from complications. All clinical ramifications of infection occur during the asexual blood-stage of infection.\n\nDuring blood-stage infection, the parasite resides in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within the erythrocyte, a cell devoid of organelles, protein synthesis and trafficking machinery. Within this unusual host cell, the parasite matures intracellularly and directs elaborate host cell remodeling, including development of various membranous structures within the erythrocyte cytoplasm and the protrusion of the erythrocyte surface into so-called knobs.\n\nThese structural and antigenic changes are presumably required for both survival within the erythrocyte as well as avoidance of the host defenses [@pone.0002405-Haldar1]. A tubovesicular membrane network (TVN) that buds from the vacuolar parasite and extends to the erythrocyte membrane is needed for nutrient uptake [@pone.0002405-Lauer1]. Maurer\\'s clefts, which are flattened, lamellar structures within the *P. falciparum-*infected erythrocyte have been linked to protein export from the PV to the erythrocyte cytoplasm and cell surface.

"1. Introduction\n===============\n\nCementum is the bone-like tissue covering the external surface of tooth root in a thin layer \\[[@B1-ijms-16-03188]\\]. Due to its intermediary position, cementum forms the interface between root dentin and periodontal ligament. In other words, cementum is a part of the tooth, but functionally, it belongs to the dental attachment apparatus \\[[@B2-ijms-16-03188]\\]. The integrity of cementum could be affected by bacterial endotoxin deposition in periodontitis, and the diseased cementum is often eliminated during periodontal therapy \\[[@B3-ijms-16-03188]\\]. Therefore, one main goal of periodontal therapy is to form new cementum and to restore periodontal attachment.

Since the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates the cell response to environmental signals, the local environment of the matrix is of great importance in order to maintain the homeostasis of cementum.

"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nRationale {#S1-1}\n---------\n\nThere has been a continuous rise in suicide rates in the United States, increasing from 10.5 to 13 per 100,000 between 1999 and 2014 ([@B1]). Suicide rates peak after age 45 for both males and females, with the highest rates in the population found in older white men aged 85 or older, for whom rates are as high as 50.7 per 100,000 ([@B2]). The known risk factors for suicide in old age remain largely unspecific, however, giving us only a limited understanding of the psychological mechanisms involved. For example, depression, physical decline, family discord, social isolation, and financial issues are well-established risk factors for suicide ([@B3]--[@B6]), but they are also present in many older adults who never engage in suicidal behavior. According to the stress--diathesis model, suicidal individuals may possess lifelong traits of vulnerability, and it is the interaction between such traits and acute stressors that triggers suicidal behavior ([@B7]). Maladaptive personality traits are strongly implicated both with suicide among younger adults and with failure to cope with the stressors of aging ([@B8]--[@B10]). Thus, the stress--diathesis framework informs two questions. First, to what extent do the personality features implicated in suicide among younger adults"

Although the mechanism of the insulin resistance is unknown, it is tightly associated with obesity \\[[@B1-molecules-22-00028]\\]. Protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B), a member of the PTP family, is thought to function as a negative regulator of insulin signal transduction. PTP1B directly interacts with an activated insulin receptor or insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine residues, resulting in down-regulation of insulin action \\[[@B2-molecules-22-00028]\\]. PTP1B knockdown mice show enhanced insulin sensitivity in glucose and insulin tolerance tests, indicating that PTP1B is a major player in the modulation of insulin sensitivity \\[[@B3-molecules-22-00028],[@B4-molecules-22-00028]\\].

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nWhen we consider end-of-life patients under palliative care, there is a tendency to think of patients with terminal cancer; indeed, in practice, palliative care is mainly focused on this type of patient. However, given current demographic changes, with progressive population ageing and longer survival, advanced chronic illnesses are becoming the leading cause of patients requiring end-of-life care. At the same time, we should consider that the palliative care model involves starting to take certain measures well before advanced stages of illness leading towards death. Ideally, palliative care should overlap with curative treatments in cases of poor prognosis, this being considered a more comprehensive patient-centred approach, taking into account not only clinical but also psychosocial and existential needs. Its objective is to avoid discomfort and suffering in the wider sense, improving quality of life as much as possible and avoiding unnecessary treatments.\n\nThe two best examples of this situation are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF), due to their prevalence and the percentage of patients in final and irreversible stages.

Select cases can be treated conservatively by aspiration or drainage in conjunction with intravenous antibiotics but the optimal treatment remains surgical with joint resection and wound closure by ipsilateral pectoralis flap advancement. However, flap coverage and primary closure over an infected wound space can lead to surgical site infection and poor wound healing, and patients can be faced with delayed closure by secondary intention. Over the last 20 years, the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has increased dramatically to promote healing of acute or chronic wounds \\[[@REF2]\\].\u00a0In addition, NPWT has been shown to be effective"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nThe effectiveness of many interventions aimed at promoting health and preventing disease has been well established \\[[@CR1]\\]. The imperative has thus shifted from amassing evidence of efficacy to delivering interventions at scale to achieve maximum population-level health gains \\[[@CR2]\\]. Governments, funders and organisations working in the preventive health sphere are increasingly developing electronic implementation monitoring, or 'e-monitoring', systems to track the distribution of prevention policies, activities and programs. Some organisations contract commercial software companies to tailor existing software programs to their needs, while others create their own bespoke systems \\[[@CR3]\\]. However, despite the continued demand for e-monitoring systems to track policy and program roll out, there is little research describing the development, use and adaptation of information technology systems, generally \\[[@CR4]\\], or for prevention, specifically. There is also no in-depth analysis of how these systems sit within the design of larger on-going processes to increase uptake of evidence-based programs within a complex system of practice with its diverse accountabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, in clinical settings, the use of e-monitoring systems to record delivery of services has not created expected gains in patient outcomes \\[[@CR5]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nObesity is a growing global public health challenge with 650 million adults worldwide estimated to be obese ([@bib67]). The accompanying changes in the levels and balance of fatty acids are key components of metabolic syndrome, a multiplex risk factor underlying cardiovascular disease that includes as cofactors insulin resistance and chronic inflammatory states ([@bib15]). In turn, both insulin resistance and meta-inflammation---a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response in metabolic tissues---are speculated to be consequences of the increased uptake of dietary fatty acids and changes in the dietary balance of fatty acids that accompany obesity ([@bib13]; [@bib50]). Meta-inflammation is characterized by elevated inflammatory cytokine levels ([@bib20]), enhanced proinflammatory signaling, and macrophage activation ([@bib42]). Meta-inflammation in combination with changes in fatty acid flux has been proposed to antagonise insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance ([@bib68]; [@bib70]; [@bib55]). Under normal conditions, engagement of the conserved insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway leads to Akt activation and the phosphorylation of FOXO (Forkhead box O) transcription factors (TFs). Phosphorylation of FOXO by Akt antagonizes FOXO function by controlling nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution and is the ultimate effector of IIS, regulating not only glucose homeostasis but also growth and longevity ([@bib56]). Identifying how meta-inflammation and altered dietary fatty"
"Introduction\n============\n\n*Staphylococcus aureus* is one of the most common and important pathogens responsible for burn wound infections ([@B1]). While burns are considered one of the most serious forms of trauma ([@B2]), burn injury remains to be a major public health concern and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world ([@B3]). Nonetheless, the surge of methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) outbreaks has caused a major setback in nosocomial infections. Moreover, these strains can produce invasive infections, especially in vulnerable patients ([@B4]).\n\nSome MRSA strains are epidemic and disseminate quickly. Therefore, the implementation of prompt monitoring programs is essential for the rapid identification of the prevailing type of bacteria in order to control the spread of resistant strains and eradicate sequential outbreaks. In addition, the typing of MRSA isolates is extremely valuable for the execution of proper infection control measures ([@B5]). Presently, there has been a breakthrough in the typing methods based on genotypic characteristics of bacteria ([@B6]).\n\nPulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is the most common tool for molecular typing and it is the method of choice for DNA fingerprinting of MRSA and other pathogens ([@B7]). Consequently, burn centers should routinely explore the particular pattern of burn wound"
"1.. Background {#s1}\n==============\n\nIn many animals, mating is essential for the production of offspring by females \\[[@RSOS181453C1],[@RSOS181453C2]\\]; however, mating seems to not be necessary in Hymenoptera, in which sex determination is haplodiploid. Usually, males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, while females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid. Thus, virgin females can produce offspring, but the sex of all these offspring is male \\[[@RSOS181453C3],[@RSOS181453C4]\\]. Mating often induces behavioural and physiological changes in female insects \\[[@RSOS181453C5]\\], including parasitoid wasps. Most commonly, these changes include increased oviposition behaviour and repression of subsequent sexual activity as a result of the transfer of male accessory gland substances \\[[@RSOS181453C6]\\]. In addition, in Hymenoptera parasitoids, virgin and mated female wasps may behave differently because of differences in the benefits and costs of mating \\[[@RSOS181453C1]\\]. Compared to mated females, unmated females are usually likely to exhibit reduced fitness, especially in highly structured populations, where brothers compete for mates and the reproductive return through sons is low, requiring females to minimize the number of male offspring \\[[@RSOS181453C7]--[@RSOS181453C9]\\]. Unmated females can increase their fitness by producing only a few small sons, sufficient for mother--son mating, to produce female offspring \\[[@RSOS181453C10],[@RSOS181453C11]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nProtein Ubiquitination\n----------------------\n\nUbiquitin is a highly conserved small modular protein consisting of 76 amino acids that can be attached to other proteins as a post translational modification (PTM). Ubiquitination can modulate the properties of the target molecule, such as its cellular localization, interaction partners, protein activity, or it can send the target protein for degradation. As such ubiquitination controls major cellular processes including DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle, protein turnover, and stress response. Protein ubiquitination is selectively mediated via the sequential action of three enzymes. First, ubiquitin is activated by a thioester bond formation with an internal active site cysteine residue of an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in an ATP dependent manner. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 enzyme to the cysteine residue of an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. Finally, an E3 ubiquitin ligase catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to specific target proteins (Hershko and Ciechanover, [@B28]). More than 600 different E3 ligases have been identified and they account for a high selectivity toward target protein ubiquitination. There are three main types of E3 ligases: RING/U-box ligases, RING-between-RING (RBR) ligases and HECT ligases, which have a different mode of action for the transfer"

Of the 5.4 million people with AD dementia in US, 5.2 million are aged 65 and older and 200,000 are less than 65 years old \\[[@ref001]\\]. AD dementia is highly prevalent among older people: the prevalence increases from \\<1% in people aged less than 65 years old, to 3% in 65--74 year olds, 17% in 75--84 year olds, to 32% in people 85 years and older \\[[@ref002]\\]. With 10,000 baby boomers reaching age 65 years every day, the number of people with AD dementia is projected to reach 13.8 million by 2050, with an estimated 1 million new cases per year \\[[@ref001]\\]. Furthermore, AD dementia is the sixth leading cause of death in the US (5th among people aged 65 years and older) \\[[@ref003]\\].

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nColon cancer is the most frequent malignancy in both sexes in Western countries, with an incidence of approximately 471,000 cases per year and a mortality of 228,000 cases per year in Europe \\[[@CR1]\\]. Lymph node involvement is the prognostic factor most directly related to survival and the disease-free interval. Thus, patients with stage I or II disease have a 5-year survival rate of more than 75% compared to 30--60% in patients at stage III or IV. In addition, the total number of lymph nodes analysed, both in cases at lymph node stage pN0 and in patients with tumour infiltration, has been shown to be a prognostic factor \\[[@CR2]--[@CR4]\\].\n\nUntil now, the pN stage in the TNM classification has been the \"gold standard\" for lymph node staging of colorectal carcinomas, but this system recommends collecting at least 12 lymph nodes for the staging to be reliable. However, new prognostic staging systems have been devised, such as the ganglion quotients or lymph node ratios (LNR) and natural logarithms of the lymph node odds (LODDS) methods, which aim to refine the construction of risk groups within the lymph node stage of this tumour and thus, provide better individualised oncological treatments"
"Introduction\n============\n\nThere is now considerable evidence that face processing involves a circumscribed set of brain regions within occipitotemporal cortex, as evidenced by single-cell recording in primates ([@bib66]), intracranial recording in humans ([@bib57]) and neuropsychological deficits such as prosopagnosia ([@bib12]). Human functional imaging studies have localized these face-sensitive regions to lateral occipital cortex (LOC), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and, more selectively, part of the middle fusiform gyrus, which has been labeled the fusiform face area (FFA) ([@bib42]). Indeed, the FFA shows a high degree of domain specificity ([@bib28]; [@bib83]), responding more strongly to faces than any other type of stimulus yet found ([@bib41]; [@bib43]).\n\nWhether activity in such face-responsive regions always correlates with the perceptual awareness of faces, however, remains unclear. According to some, activity in the ventral stream constitutes the neural correlate of visual consciousness ([@bib58]; [@bib20]). Accordingly, several studies have found that brain activity in face-responsive regions like the FFA shows a strong correlation with the detection or identification of faces under normal viewing conditions ([@bib28]), during binocular rivalry ([@bib82]), identification of ambiguous figures ([@bib44]) and the recognition of masked objects ([@bib2]). Moreover, the FFA is responsive to the subjective experience of faces induced by other objects (e.g.,"
"Introduction\n============\n\nTreatment of cancer with chemotherapy can be associated with a wide range of adverse effects as a consequence of toxicity to multiple organ systems. Dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy frequently affects tissues that harbor rapidly dividing cell populations, such as the gastrointestinal tract and the hematopoietic system. While the central nervous system (CNS) traditionally has been considered much less vulnerable to the effects of chemotherapy, recent clinical and experimental studies have revealed that varying degrees of CNS toxicity might be more prevalent than previously anticipated.\n\nCNS toxicity from chemotherapy may include acute, subacute, and delayed effects, and in some patients may result in generalized neurological decline with cognitive impairment, infrequently coupled with radiographic findings of brain atrophy and white matter (WM) abnormalities.[@b1] Cognitive impairment as a late complication of chemotherapy and radiation has long been observed in pediatric cancer patients.[@b2]--[@b6] Increasing survival rates of adult cancer patients and analysis of survivors in longitudinal studies using neuropsychological testing have revealed growing evidence that chemotherapy can be associated with long-term alteration of cognitive function.[@b7]--[@b21]\n\nNoteworthy, there are currently no standardized diagnostic tests available to monitor patients for potential neurotoxicity, or to identify those individuals at risk.

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nDespite the growing success of immunotherapy in the treatment of advanced cancer, it is clear that only a subset of cancer patients experience clinical benefit from these interventions. Recent biomarker observations have supported the premise that most clinical responders to anti-PD-1 mAb, anti-CTLA-4 mAb, and cancer vaccines show a pre-existing T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment at baseline \\[[@CR1]--[@CR3]\\]. Post-treatment biopsies from melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 have revealed an expanded number of proliferating CD8^+^ T cells penetrating deep within the tumor microenvironment \\[[@CR4]\\]. These data are consistent with preclinical data demonstrating that most of the therapeutic effect of checkpoint blockade can be attributed to re-activation of CD8^+^ T cells already present within the tumor \\[[@CR5]\\].

"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H~2~O~2~) pose a potential chemical threat in cells, so it was surprising enough when they turned up as essential signaling components downstream of receptor activation. Now Garrett DeYulia, Juan C\u00e1rcamo, David Golde (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) and colleagues have found that H~2~O~2~ can be generated outside cells, independent of any intracellular events, by ligand binding to cytokine receptors.\n\nFigureCytokine binding prompts extracellular H~2~O~2~ production.C\u00c1RCAMO/NAS\n\nThe group had earlier seen that extracellular catalase, which breaks down H~2~O~2~, inhibited signaling through the GM-CSF receptor. They now find that ligand binding to this receptor increases the amount of extracellular H~2~O~2~. This occurs even when the cells are fixed before ligand addition or with a version of the receptor lacking intracellular signaling domains. H~2~O~2~ production was also evident with EGF binding to its receptor in the presence of an inhibitor of downstream signaling.\n\nExtracellular destruction of H~2~O~2~ reduced signaling and cell survival downstream of GM-CSF binding. Addition of extracellular H~2~O~2~, by contrast, induced phosphorylation of downstream targets.\n\nH~2~O~2~ makes a good second messenger---it is small, diffusible, and can be destroyed easily.

"Background\n==========\n\nIn clinical practice the successful treatment of schizophrenia may require switching between antipsychotics \\[[@B1]\\]. The reasons for changing treatments include inadequate or complete lack of efficacy, partial compliance or noncompliance with medication, and the presence of adverse events such as movement disorders, weight gain, somnolence, endocrine side effects, and metabolic dysfunction. The possibility of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms due to withdrawal of the original antipsychotic before the new antipsychotic has become effective is a major consideration \\[[@B1]-[@B4]\\]. Conversely, when drugs with long half-lives are quickly replaced with new treatments, consideration must be given to possible excessive drug effects.\n\nGuidelines on changing a patient\\'s antipsychotic medications were provided by a Consensus Study Group in 1996 \\[[@B5]\\]. Their primary purpose was to assist clinicians in switching patients from conventional antipsychotics and from clozapine to the new antipsychotic risperidone. The guidelines suggest that for hospitalized schizophrenia patients who are at low risk for psychotic exacerbation or aggressive or suicidal reactions and who are receiving antipsychotics other than clozapine, the previous antipsychotic can be withdrawn completely before risperidone is started. Gradual withdrawal while introducing the other antipsychotic, however, may be necessary in patients who are combative or assaultive, those with a history"
"Influenza A and B viruses cause global outbreaks of mild-to-severe respiratory disease each year and are among the most significant public health problems worldwide. The influenza A viruses can be divided into subtypes depending on the antigenicity of their two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)[@b1]. In contrast, the influenza B virus is not divided into subtypes and has only two genetically distinct lineages in humans, B/Vitoria/2/87-like (Victoria lineage) and B/Yamagata/16/88-like (Yamagata lineage). The B/Victoria lineage was predominant during the 1980s, while the B/Yamagata lineage was predominant throughout most of the world during the 1990s[@b2]. However, a recent study revealed that one of each influenza B linage viruses has been predominantly circulating approximately once every three years with genetic shift and antigenic drift[@b3]. While influenza B viruses are believed to cause milder clinical disease in mammalian hosts than influenza A viruses, these viruses are essential components of influenza vaccines administered to susceptible groups, such as children and young adults[@b4]. In most years, the vaccination process is successful; however, antigenic drift and mismatches between circulating viruses and selected vaccine strains have occurred with significant consequences[@b5], and little cross-protection between lineages is considered to exist[@b4].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nDue to the brain's limited processing capacity, human perception cannot provide a complete representation of the sensory input from the environment. Instead, our brain combines this external, bottom-up sensory information with internal, top-down influences to selectively enhance the processing and perception of information that we assume to be relevant. Voluntary attention is the major top-down influence for this selection process. It can lead to improved processing of attended locations, objects, and features, such as decreased reaction times (RTs) and higher accuracy rates for attended compared to unattended sensory signals (e.g., Posner, [@B29]). Perceptually, attention seems to enhance the integrated saliency (Treue, [@B39]) such as the perceived contrast and size of stimuli (Carrasco et al., [@B10]; Anton-Erxleben et al., [@B2]). While attentional effects have been extensively studied in the visual domain, far less research has been devoted to somatosensory attention (for an overview, see Mueller and Giabbiconi, [@B27]).\n\nIn touch, as in vision, the best-explored attentional phenomenon is spatial attention.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nDevelopment and maintenance of bone and muscle mass are fundamental processes in mammalian physiology, since the musculoskeletal system allows movement and provides support and protection for vital organs \\[[@CR1]\\]. The musculoskeletal system does not only have an essential mechanical function, muscle and bone also provide a systemic supply of metabolites and signaling molecules. Bone serves as an ion pool for maintaining serum levels of Ca^2+^, Mg^2+^, and other physiological key elements and produces active endocrine products such as FGF23 and osteocalcin \\[[@CR2]--[@CR4]\\].

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nOne of the main goals in the rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is to develop novel nanoscale functional materials that uniquely differ in their physical and chemical properties as compared to bulk counterparts. Originally created with the motivation to investigate materials\\' behavior at molecular level [@B1], nanocrystals were soon born and have since triggered great interest. Semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots (QDs), are among the most exciting and ubiquitous discoveries that have come out of the nanotechnology field. A QD is a cluster of a few hundred to thousands of atoms [@B2] arranged in binary (*e.g.* CdSe, CdTe, GaAs, InAs, AlN, SiC and *etc.*) or ternary compounds (*e.g.* InGaN, InGaP, InGaAs and *etc.*). The size of a QD typically ranges from 1 to 20 nm [@B2]. At such small scales, QDs exhibit a molecule-like behavior by interacting with light through electronic transition dipoles [@B1]. Upon excitation by a photon, a single electron is promoted from the valence band to the conduction band, creating an electron-hole pair (*i.e.* exciton). As the size of QDs become relatively small as compared to the bulk exciton Bohr radius, which is typically a few nanometer (\\~5.6 nm for CdSe) [@B1], the wave function"

It is the priority of parasitological journals, including an online-only journal like IJP:PAW, to publish comprehensive species descriptions in an open-access format. Describing a new species can appear to be a complicated task that is regulated by objective rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (whether you like it or not). Either you do it correctly, and everyone congratulates you.

Furthermore, among Japanese adults with abdominal obesity, aged 40--74 years, 20 million are estimated to have metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.[@b3-dmso-10-297] This suggests that Japanese individuals are susceptible to cardiovascular diseases or other serious complications at even mild levels of overweight.\n\nTo prevent and/or mitigate these concerns, weight loss through dietary restriction and regular exercise is considered the best available non-surgical, non-pharmacologic treatment strategy.[@b4-dmso-10-297] Moreover, additive or synergetic effects of diet and exercise have received much attention in recent years.[@b5-dmso-10-297],[@b6-dmso-10-297] Our team has been studying the effects of amino acids combined with exercise on fat oxidation for the past two decades.[@b7-dmso-10-297]--[@b14-dmso-10-297] We demonstrated that a 12-week administration of a mixture of 17 amino acids combined with regular exercise increased aerobic fitness and reduced abdominal visceral fat in sedentary older women.[@b12-dmso-10-297] We also reported that acute administration of different"

However, the introduction of intravitreal injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents has shown promising results in recent years.

"The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction. All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.\n\nIntroduction {#s1}\n============\n\nPlants make use of a bipartite immune system to cope with microbial infection [@ppat.1004491-Jones1]. Microbial pattern recognition by host-encoded immune receptors is essential for the activation of plant antimicrobial defenses. Perception by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) [@ppat.1004491-Boller1], [@ppat.1004491-Dodds1]. PTI is an ancient form of plant immunity that provides protection to host non-adapted pathogens, but limited or basal immunity to host-adapted microbes only. In addition, plant-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released either by the deleterious activities of secreted microbial enzymes or toxins that activate plant PTI in a PRR-dependent manner [@ppat.1004491-Boller1], [@ppat.1004491-Ottmann1]. Host-adapted plant pathogens employ effectors to suppress PTI and to establish infection [@ppat.1004491-Dou1]. Co-evolution of hosts and host-adapted microbes has resulted in effector-triggered immunity (ETI), which is dependent on immune receptors recognizing effectors directly or indirectly through sensing effector-mediated manipulations of host targets [@ppat.1004491-Jones1], [@ppat.1004491-Dodds1], [@ppat.1004491-Spoel1].\n\nPlants recognize a wide range of proteinaceous, carbohydrate or lipophilic PAMPs [@ppat.1004491-Boller1], [@ppat.1004491-Nrnberger1].

Controlling membrane dynamics in developmental intercellular fusion, intracellular trafficking, and cell invasion by enveloped viruses and parasites may lead to new strategies for quelling diseases. An understanding of membrane remodeling at the physicochemical level that might guide the development of such strategies requires interdisciplinary investigation of protein--lipid interactions. Only proteins have sufficient complexity and information content to organize and regulate membranes, whereas fusion and fission ultimately unite and separate membrane lipids.\n\nIn this mini-review, we focus on the hypothesis that all fusion is essentially lipidic at its core ([@bib11]; [@bib60]). The hemifusion--fusion or stalk--pore pathway of membrane fusion was identified and explored first in theoretical work and experiments on artificial protein-free bilayers ([@bib22]; [@bib6]; [@bib31]), and then in viral fusion (for review see [@bib4]), in intracellular fusion ([@bib7]; [@bib34]; [@bib45]; [@bib56]), and, most recently, in developmental cell fusion ([@bib39]). This pathway starts with hemifusion, a stalklike connection between the contacting membrane leaflets where the distal leaflets and the"
"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer (AD), Parkinson (PD), Huntington (HD), and Lou Gehrig or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are characterized by inexorable degeneration of specific neural clusters. This class of diseases poses a serious clinical challenge because once the neurodegeneration begins, it can only be slowed down but not fully halted ([@B71]). Typically, the progression of neurodegeneration starts in the subcortical regions and spreads to cortical regions as the disease progresses ([@B257]). The primary neuronal loss varies with the disease such as striatal regions in PD, striatal and cortical regions in HD, hippocampal and cortical regions in AD, and spinal motor neurons and cortical regions in ALS ([@B113]; [@B153]; [@B131]).\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases share a range of molecular and cellular pathologies, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate toxicity, calcium load, proteolytic stress, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and aging, resulting in neuronal death ([@B131]; [@B74]). In these diseases, there are specific neuronal clusters that are primarily vulnerable, which become the original site from which the pathology spreads ([@B71]). These vulnerable neurons have complex morphological features such as long-range neuronal projections and extensive synaptic connections, which makes them selectively vulnerable due to their higher metabolic demands to maintain their structural complexity ([@B17];"

Above all wind energy is very variable in time and when it is massively delivered to the grid a lot of control problems arise \\[[@bib1], [@bib2]\\]. This is due to the fact that a grid must be in a perfect balance between instantaneous electrical power demand and production in order to maintain a constant network frequency. In this scenario, the hydraulic storage plants play an ever more strategic role for the management of the network stability \\[[@bib3], [@bib4], [@bib5]\\], thanks to their capability to store and provide great amount of electrical energy in very short time, using reversible turbomachineries. However, this implies a much heavier use of the turbomachineries of the storage plants which have been often used for thirty or forty years and therefore they are nowadays subjected to increasing reliability and fatigue problems. Furthermore, the design of such hydro-turbomachineries dates back to a period when no advanced 3D calculation codes were available and the machineries were designed using simplified 1D models and empirical corrections.

"Background\n==========\n\nBetween 1977 and 1996, a dramatic shift in food sources in the U.S. was observed that reflected a significant increase in calories consumed from away-from-home versus home-prepared food.\\[[@B1]\\] Trends indicate that more Americans eat out, and today, almost 50% of the U.S. food dollar is spent at full-service and fast food restaurants\\[[@B2],[@B3]\\]. Meals purchased away from home are playing an increasingly important role in the amount and type of foods consumed \\[[@B1],[@B4]\\]. Household economics, opportunity costs, time constraints, and convenience appear to be major factors that influence greater reliance on food prepared outside the home \\[[@B5]-[@B7]\\].\n\nFast-food places have surpassed full-service restaurants as the largest source of away-from-home foods\\[[@B1]\\], which may explain why many researchers believe that consumption of fast-food items is a contributor to obesity\\[[@B8],[@B9]\\].

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nAn individual's sensitization profile is clinically important due to the associated risk of the development and persistence of asthma and allergy symptoms throughout life \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\]. The calculation and interpretation of the sensitivity and specificity of IgE tests require clinical data from the subject's case history to back up the clinical diagnosis. A population-based cohort study on adolescents in southern Sweden recently reported on the prevalence of various allergic symptoms: wheeze 10%, rhinoconjunctivitis 13%, food hypersensitivity 12% and eczema 11% \\[[@CR3]\\]. The same study also showed that a parental history of asthma, hay fever and eczema was significantly more common among children with allergic diseases, and that wheeze was more common among those with parents who smoked.

"Decagonal quasicrystals (QCs) are extremely tempting structures to study due to the unique combination of the periodic and QP orders in the same crystal. The lattice of such materials can be obtained by appropriate projection of the periodic lattice in five-dimensional space to the three-dimensional (3D) space[@b1]. The real and the reciprocal space (**k**-space) lattice vectors of decagonal QCs thus can be denoted by five vectors[@b2] ([Fig. 1a](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}), spanning a reciprocal lattice in aperiodic plane and a set of discrete maxima with 2*\u03c0/c* spacing in the periodic (00001) direction, where *c*\u22484\u2009\u00c5 is a lattice parameter for d-AlNiCo in this direction[@b3]. The corresponding low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern from the clean tenfold surface of d-AlNiCo measured at electron beam energy *E*~e~=43\u2009eV at room temperature is shown in [Fig. 1b](#f1){ref-type=\"fig\"}.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe leading cause for lung cancer is cigarette smoking. More than 80% of lung cancer patients either actively smoke or have been smoking in the past even though other factors such as exposure to asbestos, radon, and genetic factors may contribute to disease as well. Notably, at the time of diagnosis about one third of the patients are already in an advanced stage IV of disease therefore limiting curative therapeutic options, while 15--20% of patients exhibit signs of disease at an early stage. Tumors are classified by morphological appearance and are divided into small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with NSCLC accounting for approximately 75--80% of all lung cancers. This group is divided further into squamous cell (35--40%) and adenocarcinomas (30--40%), where as the large cell and the undifferentiated non-small cell lung cancers account for the remaining subtypes [@pone.0007315-Rom1].\n\nDespite intensive research the molecular events essential for the development of lung adenocarcinomas remain elusive, even though it is well established, that the disease involves activation of oncogenes.

"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization, CVD was responsible for 30% of all deaths in 2005. Although typically considered a disease of developed countries, its incidence is increasing in the developing world as well. CVD usually stems from vascular dysfunction, for example, as a result of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, or high blood pressure, which then compromises organ function. Most notably, the heart and brain can be affected, as in myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. In the past few decades, major improvements have been made in treating some types of CVD. However, new treatment options are urgently needed for all types of CVD. Moreover, improving diagnosis is crucial, because by detecting the early stages of disease, the focus of therapy could be shifted from treatment to prevention [@bib1].

"Graphene, owing to its novel magnetotransport properties[@b1][@b2][@b3], high carrier mobility and ballistic transport up to room temperature[@b4], has attracted enormous attention since its discovery in 2004[@b5]. To harness these properties for applications, large-scale synthesis is urgently required. Several methods for graphene production have been proposed. Micromechanical cleavage was used to make graphene[@b5]. However, it is difficult to scale up this process to large-scale production. Alternatively, graphene is also usually achieved by using dispersion and exfoliation of graphene oxide[@b6]. However, the graphene oxide is significant different from graphene[@b7]. Although it can be reduced to remove the redundant functional groups, this inevitably contributes to a significant number of defects as well as a quite complicated process[@b7]. Graphene can be grown on the surface of transition metals such as Ru (0001)[@b8], but this method requires transfer of the resulting graphene to another substrate to make useful devices. Recently, growth of graphene has been fulfilled by graphitization of SiC substrates[@b9][@b10][@b11][@b12]. The epitaxial growth methods bring us to very new world for producing graphene.

"1. Introduction {#sec1-materials-11-01129}\n===============\n\nThe specific detection of microorganisms of interest from complex multispecies microbial communities in the natural environment and engineering systems such as activated sludge is crucial to understanding the presence and activity of key microorganisms. However, traditional cultivation and microscopic techniques are not adequate because most microorganisms present in the natural environment and engineering systems cannot be cultivated. In activated sludge, only a small fraction (1% to 10%) of total microorganisms have been isolated and characterized to date \\[[@B1-materials-11-01129]\\]. Therefore, culture-independent molecular biology techniques have been widely applied for the specific detection of key microorganisms and the microbial community structures. Among the specific detection techniques, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) are essential to detect specific microorganisms in complex microbial communities, although high throughput sequencing techniques are rapidly being developed. In FISH and qPCR techniques, the specificity of probe (for FISH) and primers (for qPCR) is the critical parameter for detecting specific microorganisms, including candidate division microorganisms, which have not been successfully isolated but their presence was suggested using 16S rRNA sequencing \\[[@B2-materials-11-01129],[@B3-materials-11-01129],[@B4-materials-11-01129]\\].

"*Fast Facts about the Nursing Profession* is a brief, accessible and very informative text in the Fast Facts series, which provides practitioners with vital information leading to success in clinical practice. Unlike other volumes in the series which concentrate on clinical education and practice, this handbook is not a 'how to' book, but a history of nursing long before it was considered to be a profession. All contributors to the book are nursing instructors at American universities. Fast Fact chapbooks are designed to fill a gap in health education. In this case, the gap is the lack of historical content in contemporary nursing programmes. A foreword by Marilyn Klainberg states the purpose of the book, which is to introduce the historical and global foundations of nursing to those in the profession today. Klainberg maintains that contemporary nursing is a product of its history which has been shaped by global events such as politics, wars, religion, travel and the environment.\n\nStressing that the current literature on the history of nursing is not written from a global perspective, this book is intended to fill that gap. A preface by Deborah Dolan Hunt is a plea for including historical content in nursing curricula."

Such conditions increase the probability of diminished attention to the task and produce responses that are not based on the item content (e.g.,\u00a0careless responding; [@ref-56]), with a consequent deterioration of the validity and a need to implement control measures that further prolong the testing session ([@ref-22]; [@ref-49]; [@ref-64]; [@ref-77]).\n\nAs a consequence, possessing short-form measures that can deliver an acceptable proxy for a person's position on broad constructs is clearly of interest in terms of both research and applied assessment ([@ref-17]). This is particularly true in the case of multidimensional and multifaceted constructs such as human personality, the assessment of which has traditionally required extensive scales. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to develop more efficient measures of basic personality traits. A representative example can be found in the diverse levels of reduction of scales evaluating the Big Five based on the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP; [@ref-31]): 300 items (IPIP-NEO; [@ref-31]), 120 items (IPIP NEO 120; [@ref-41]), 50 items (IPIP Big Five Factor markers; [@ref-30]), 32 items (IPIP-IPC; [@ref-50]), and 20 items (Mini-IPIP; [@ref-24]).\n\nThe Mini-IPIP"
"Background\n==========\n\nRice is both a food crop and a model system for scientific research. While the wild plant Arabidopsis has become the paramount model plant system, the spectrum of its traits cannot address fundamental questions of crop plant domestication and performance, therefore, an efficient experimental system based on a crop plant is needed. At the time of this publication, rice is the only crop for which complete genome sequence has been made available \\[[@B1]-[@B3]\\]. To realize the full potential of rice genomics, however, an appropriate genomic toolbox must be assembled. While methods such as expression profiling, proteomic and metabolomic analysis can provide insight into the function of genes and pathways, a complete analysis of function must involve disruption or modification of gene action.\n\nSeveral approaches are available for the functional inactivation of rice genes. Tagging has been achieved with endogenous \\[[@B4]\\] and introduced transposons \\[[@B5],[@B6]\\], and with the T-DNA of *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*\\[[@B5],[@B7]\\]. The growing tagged gene databases will provide knock-outs for a majority of rice genes \\[[@B5]\\], but a substantial number will be missed.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nInsomnia is a subjective feeling of having difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep or having a feeling of non-restorative sleep [@pone.0050933-AmericanPsychiatric1]. Increasing evidence suggests that insomnia is associated with subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD) in populations initially free of heart disease [@pone.0050933-Elwood1]--[@pone.0050933-Spiegelhalder1]. Previously, we found a dose-dependent association between number of insomnia symptoms and the risk of acute myocardial infarction which was stronger in women than in men [@pone.0050933-Laugsand1]. However, the nature of this association is not yet clear. Atherosclerosis, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of CHD, is known to develop decades before the first clinical symptoms. It is possible that both insomnia and subsequent CHD are associated with subclinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. Since insomnia is a common and potentially treatable condition, it is important to understand if insomnia is a causal factor or only a correlate of CHD.\n\nThe endothelium is a thin layer of cells that forms the inner surface of the blood vessel, forming an interface between circulating blood and the rest of the vessel wall.

"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nGene expression refers to the appearance of a characteristic or effect in the phenotype that can be attributed to a particular gene. The development of microarray technologies has helped biomedical researchers make significant advances in the last decade by allowing high-throughput gene expression screening on all known genes. The introduction of RNAseq technology further revolutionized the field of gene expression research with accurate measurements of transcripts instead of estimating relative measures and with the detection of structural variants such as splicing and gene fusion. RNAseq uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to sequence cDNA that has been reverse transcribed from RNA. It is commonly believed to be superior to microarray technology due to its ability to quantify gene expression at higher resolution (exon and CDS level) and detect structural variations. As early as 2008 \\[[@B23]\\], RNAseq has been hailed as the eventual replacement of microarray technology, and since then, multiple studies \\[[@B2]--[@B31]\\] have also illustrated the advantages of RNAseq and come to similar conclusions by analyzing real data or through thorough simulation study.\n\nRNAseq technology introduces new and exciting opportunities to researchers in the field of biomedical research as well as stiff analysis challenges for bioinformaticians.

"Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a T cell--mediated inflammatory skin disease most frequently caused by low molecular weight electrophilic chemicals or metal ions. Activation of DCs by contact allergens is a prerequisite for the induction of the pathogenic skin-specific T cell response ([@bib33]; [@bib52]).\n\nDC activation proceeds via a broad variety of germline-encoded innate immune receptors, in particular the pattern recognition receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs; [@bib24]; [@bib36]; [@bib44]). TLR and NLR recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns as well as endogenous danger signals ([@bib57]; [@bib23]; [@bib44]) associated with tissue destruction, termed damage-associated molecular patterns ([@bib50]). Triggering of pattern recognition receptors by pathogen-associated molecular patterns or damage-associated molecular patterns leads to an inflammatory response involving the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides.\n\nInflammatory responses induced by contact allergens in the skin share many features with the innate immune responses to pathogens ([@bib18]). In the mouse contact hypersensitivity (CHS) model, we have recently demonstrated a critical role for TLR2 and TLR4 in the DC-mediated sensitization process ([@bib34]). Moreover, contact allergens trigger oxidative stress and antioxidant responses ([@bib37]; [@bib25]; [@bib42]; [@bib2]).

It can be transmitted to humans through close contact with infected animals or animal products and through the consumptions of unpasteurised milk and dairy products ([@CIT0003]). In addition, it is an occupational hazard to persons involved in certain professions such as farming, ranchers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers ([@CIT0002], [@CIT0004]).\n\nIn humans, brucellosis is an acute febrile illness and behaves as a systemic infection with a very variable clinical spectrum.

"**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR PATIENTS**? {#sec1}\n=====================================\n\nEndometriosis and pelvic pain affect more than 1 in 10 women. In endometriosis, tissue that is similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus grows outside the uterus and most commonly involves the ovaries, tubes, and the lining of the pelvis. The birth control pill, which contains female hormones, is commonly used as a treatment for pelvic pain in women with endometriosis. In this study, we asked women with endometriosis and pelvic pain about their experiences of using the birth control pill. For women who said that the birth control pill was not effective for their pain, they reported higher levels of pain and more often had muscle pain. It is therefore important to recognize when women with endometriosis actually have muscle pain, as the birth control pill may not be helpful in their treatment. Women who said that they had to stop the birth control pill because of side-effects reported a worse quality-of-life. Ideally, doctors should find ways to help reduce these side-effects of the birth control pill or find new treatments for these women.\n\nIntroduction {#sec2}\n============\n\nChronic pelvic pain (CPP) is defined as a constant"

Most sufferers experience only occasional symptoms, and can be treated with reassurance and lifestyle advice.

This has been termed \\\"malignant\\\" vasovagal syncope because of the associated falls and physical injury. In these cases, a more interventional approach may be appropriate.\n\nPharmacological measures have been the mainstay of treatment for recurrent vasovagal syncope: beta-blockers (e.g. atenolol), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine), certain vasoconstricting drugs (e.g. midodrine) and fluid retaining agents (e.g. fludrocortisone) have been of particular interest.

In some cases STEC infection can lead to life-threatening complications, including neurological damage and hemolytic-uremic syndrome [@pone.0032393-Caprioli1], [@pone.0032393-Croxen1]. Several hundred STEC serotypes have been isolated and some of them, like O157:H7, are highly virulent in humans [@pone.0032393-Kaper1], [@pone.0032393-Caprioli1]. Although STEC possess a broad range of virulence factors, attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions and the ability to produce one or more toxins of the Shiga toxin (Stx) family are the hallmarks of infections caused by STEC [@pone.0032393-Kaper1]--[@pone.0032393-Johannes1]. Stxs are AB~5~ holotoxins that catalyze the removal of a specific adenine residue from the 28 S rRNA of the 60 S ribosomal subunit, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis in the target cell [@pone.0032393-Croxen1], [@pone.0032393-Johannes1]. Two broad groups of Stxs have been reported: Stx1 and Stx2. While Stx1 show little sequence variation, Stx2 are a heterogeneous group and several variants have been described [@pone.0032393-Johannes1].

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nAn important aspect of managing library digital resources is determining their usefulness and value to library users. Resources employed in medical libraries have an even stricter mandate to provide the most up-to-date, peer-reviewed content, often with an additional time constraint for rush patient care. This perceived need has opened up another line item in many medical libraries' budgets: a multi-search discovery product that provides simultaneous access to multiple types of materials, independently of the management platform involved \\[[@b1-jmla-106-471]\\]. Discovery products provide an interface with search and retrieval capabilities, often with advanced filtering and sharing features. Medical librarians and their clients need the sophisticated searching tools of resources like PubMed but also insist on the speed and simplicity of search engines like Google. Finding such a high-performance tool that searches medical information is a difficult task in collection development for electronic resources.\n\nIn 2012, in response to this need for quick and thorough medical database searches, Mount Carmel Health Sciences Library (MCHSL) implemented a unique federated search tool that specialized in simultaneously searching the library's suite of 24 biomedical databases, including PubMed and products from Elsevier (ClinicalKey), McGraw-Hill (AccessMedicine), ProQuest, and EBSCO, as well as the library's online catalog"

During a regular influenza season, about 90% of the deaths occur in people older than 65 years ([@bib60]). Immune responses to vaccines are known to be particularly ineffective in the elderly population (\\>65 years of age), and yet some vaccines, such as those for influenza, are given primarily to the elderly. A major correlate of protection for vaccinations is the specific antibody titer generated by long-lived plasma B cells. With a lifespan of several decades, long-lived lymphocytes are particularly prone to accumulation of intracellular waste. Autophagy recycles unwanted cytoplasmic material. Autophagy-deficient lymphocytes are unable to generate adequate responses, in particular long-lived lymphocytes, memory T and B cells, and plasma B cells ([@bib3], [@bib38], [@bib43], [@bib59]).

"Background\n==========\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is defined as persistent or relapsing fatigue that has occurred for at least 6 months, is not alleviated by rest, and causes substantial reduction in activities. The fatigue cannot be explained by medical or psychiatric conditions and must be accompanied by at least 4 of 8 specified symptoms (unusual post exertional fatigue, impaired memory or concentration, unrefreshing sleep, headaches, muscle pain, joint pain, sore throat, and tender cervical nodes) \\[[@B1]\\].

"The ongoing outbreaks of MERS[@b1] and Ebola[@b2] and emerging pan-drug resistant bacterial pathogens[@b3] remind us that infectious diseases are still a great public health problem. Rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens is of great importance for timely treatment and prevention of the spread of outbreaks[@b4][@b5]. Because of their specificity and sensitivity, molecular diagnostic methods are receiving increasing attention. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most popular technique for molecular detection of pathogens. For viral pathogens, their genomic nucleic acids exist in high abundance in clinical samples, making them easy to detect[@b6]. However, for bacterial pathogens, particularly those that survive in host cells, bacterial load is relatively low, making them challenging to detect[@b7][@b8].

"1. Introduction {#sec1-genes-10-00361}\n===============\n\nFor a long time, very small proteins (\u00b5-proteins) have been nearly totally neglected. Genome annotations typically used a lower limit of 100 codons to include an open reading frame (ORF) as a predicted protein-coding gene. On the one hand, the annotation of a vast number of false-positive genes was prevented, on the other hand, real genes for \u00b5-proteins were also not included and thus they escaped attention. In addition, experimental protein-analytical methods had been previously optimized for normal-sized proteins, which led to the loss of \u00b5-proteins during purification or analyses.\n\nDuring the last years the awareness has emerged that many \u00b5-proteins do exist in prokaryotes, as well as in eukaryotes, and that they have important biological functions. Several recent reviews summarize the current knowledge about \u00b5-proteins in prokaryotes \\[[@B1-genes-10-00361],[@B2-genes-10-00361],[@B3-genes-10-00361]\\] and in eukaryotes \\[[@B4-genes-10-00361],[@B5-genes-10-00361],[@B6-genes-10-00361]\\].

In 2018, there were 106,430 new cases and 47,739 deaths due to cervical cancer in China ([@b3-ol-0-0-11974]). The average morbidity and mortality are on the increase with annual rates of 8.7% and 8.1%, respectively ([@b4-ol-0-0-11974]). However, precursor lesions with regards to the diagnosis of cervical cancer could reduce its incidence and improve the patient\\'s quality of life.\n\nEffective early screening technology that detects precursor lesions includes the Pap smear and the ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT). Previous reports showed that the TCT has higher sensitivity ([@b5-ol-0-0-11974]), and is one of the most common cervical cancer screening methods ([@b6-ol-0-0-11974]). The diagnosis from TCT samples is mainly dependent on a pathologist\\'s interpretation under a microscope, according to the Bethesda report system ([@b7-ol-0-0-11974]).

"THERE are three main theories regarding the origin of introns: \"Introns Late,\" \"Introns Early,\" and \"Introns First\" ([@bib28]). The Introns Late and Introns Early theories suggest that introns arose within the eukaryotic lineage, and before the Prokaryota-Eukaryota split, respectively, whereas Introns First implies that these noncoding sequences appeared before protein-coding genes. Introns are maintained, lost or gained with different rates within different eukaryotic lineages. The recent evolution of the yeast genome has seen widespread intron loss, with the result that only 5% of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* genes contain introns ([@bib16]). It has been proposed that small organisms with a large effective population size, such as *S. cerevisiae*, have seen deleterious introns gradually eliminated from the genome ([@bib38]). This raises the question of why some introns are maintained in the yeast genome and, furthermore, whether they are functionally relevant.\n\nRecent studies indicate that *S. cerevisiae* introns increase fitness under stress ([@bib48]), aid ribosome assembly, and regulate expression of the paralogous copy of the gene ([@bib49]). Introns may contain regulatory sequences and structures that affect splicing or expression of their host genes. In the *[HAC1](http://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000001863/overview)* transcript, short RNA hairpins define the intron boundaries ([@bib60]).

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nSmall bowel obstruction (SBO) after gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (R-Y reconstruction) is not a rare complication. Early small bowel obstruction (ESBO) within the first 30 postoperative days after the reconstructive surgery can be caused by technical problems, such as kinking, narrowing, or acute angulation of the anastomosis, while late SBO can occur secondary to internal hernia or intra-abdominal adhesions \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\].\n\nMost patients diagnosed with ESBO after R-Y reconstruction are observed conservatively and do not require surgical intervention \\[[@CR1]--[@CR4]\\]. However, some patients need re-operation under general anesthesia for both diagnosis and treatment when their situation does not improve, and these cases usually have a high rate of postoperative complications \\[[@CR5], [@CR6]\\].\n\nRecently, endoscopic or fluoroscopic balloon dilation has been performed to avoid re-operation for ESBO or Crohn's disease, as it is minimally invasive and preserves intestinal length \\[[@CR7], [@CR8]\\].\n\nWe report three cases in which fluoroscopic balloon dilation (FBD) was successfully performed to avoid re-operation for early jejunojejunostomy obstruction (JJO) after gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction.\n\nCase presentation {#Sec2}\n=================\n\nCase 1 {#Sec3}\n------\n\nA 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital for surgery for advanced gastric cancer.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nIn 1952, a patient developed surgery-associated adrenal insufficiency as a result of preoperative withdrawal from glucocorticoid therapy \\[[@CR1]\\]. That case report, and one other in the ensuing 12 months \\[[@CR2]\\], prompted the publication of recommendations for perioperative glucocorticoid coverage, which became the standard care. Recommendation of glucocorticoid administration was then tapered depending on the magnitude of stress, from minor surgical stress (e.g., inguinal herniorrhaphy) to major surgical stress (e.g., pancreato-duodenectomy or cardiac surgery). Thus, higher glucocorticoid doses were provided for major surgical stress, e.g., 100--150\u2009mg cortisone equivalent per day for 2--3 days.\n\nThe hormonal responses to surgery, critical illness, and trauma have been studied intensively. There is however a considerable inter-individual variation in the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal cortical (HPA) response to surgical stress \\[[@CR3]\\]. Some of the variation can be attributed to the actions of premedication with benzodiazepines and of anesthetics \\[[@CR4]\\], as the anesthesia during endoscopic pituitary surgery is often a combination of propofol and remifentanil. The latter is an ultrashort-acting opioid which reduces cortisol \\[[@CR5]\\].\n\nIn recent years, patients with normal preoperative cortisol levels generally do not receive hydrocortisone (HC) during surgery for pituitary adenoma \\[[@CR6]--[@CR8]\\].

Perhaps the key to the adaptive radiation of this clade was the evolutionary plasticity of the larval phase, which allowed new habitats to be rapidly explored through the adaptation of larval dispersal mechanisms. The result is a great variation in larval duration, size and morphology in the extant Crustacea, where multi-phasic lifecycles can see a single organism exploiting several distinct ecological niches throughout its lifetime. Each of these larval phases is transitioned by a metamorphosis, which typically occurs at a critical time in development and may be directed by a plethora of biotic and abiotic factors \\[[@CR2]\\].\n\nOur understanding of molecular endocrinology in arthropods is quite well developed, with model insects lending an abundance of resources and knowledge to the field. Studies into developmental pathways are particularly prolific, and subsequently the basis for insect metamorphosis has been well-examined over the past few decades.

Opioid receptor agonists produce constipation by inhibiting enteric neuron function. \u03bc- and \u03b4-opiate receptors (MOR and DOR) are expressed by enteric neurons and these receptors use common signaling pathways in the enteric nervous system (ENS).

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nRice is one of the few plant species that can survive submerged conditions. In particular, it can successfully germinate by extending a coleoptile underwater in the complete absence of oxygen ([@PLU026C26]). Most of the early biochemical studies reported that even under anoxia, rice is able to metabolize reserve carbohydrates via glycolysis and fermentation to generate sufficient cellular energy, i.e. ATP needed for plant growth ([@PLU026C31]; [@PLU026C1]; [@PLU026C32]; [@PLU026C10]). Microarray data show that this is associated with a strong up-regulation of sucrose and starch metabolism, glycolysis and fermentation genes ([@PLU026C19]). This work also showed many other significantly up- and down-regulated genes associated with various metabolic and signalling pathways. These findings highlight that rice globally reconfigures its molecular machinery under anoxic stress by selectively synthesizing the necessary transcripts coding for enzymes that produce and conserve energy.\n\nDespite past efforts to characterize the biochemical adaptations of rice under anoxia, current knowledge on how oxygen deficiency is sensed and on the regulatory cascade that fine-tunes the transcriptional and translational changes is still very limited.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as well as multi-slice spiral computed tomography (MSCT) have become routine tools for cardiac imaging. One of the most relevant clinical applications is visualisation of myocardial viability. As dysfunctional but viable myocardium has the potential for functional recovery after reperfusion,[@R01] non-invasive assessment of myocardial viability allows for selecting patients who will benefit from a revascularisation therapy. This is an appealing idea, as revascularisation by percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting is cost intensive and still associated with relevant morbidity and mortality.\n\nMoreover, the extent and degree of myocardial injury determines patient outcome and survival.[@R02] After revascularisation, the annual mortality rate in patients with viable myocardium is half as high as in patients without viable myocardium. In patients with viable myocardium, medical treatment alone results in a five-fold higher annual mortality rate when compared with revascularisation.[@R03]\n\nThe transmural extent of infarction is also of crucial importance, as this determines outcome.

The knowledge of potential differences in drug metabolism impacted by genetic variants can inform drug selection or dosing over a patient's lifetime since the results will not change with age and many of the variants occur in genes involved in the pathways for multiple medications. In particular, the genes encoding liver enzymes in the cytochrome P450 family, including CYP2D6 and"

Experimental data has indicated that AKI may cause permanent kidney damage through tubulointerstitial fibrosis and progressive nephron loss while also lowering the threshold for subsequent injury\\[[@pone.0179137.ref001]\\]. As the number of AKI patients increases, the need to better understand the mechanisms driving these processes becomes paramount. Optimizing care for AKI patients will require an understanding of the short- and long-term risks associated with AKI, identifying patients at the highest risk of poor outcomes, and testing interventions that target modifiable risk factors.\n\nApoptosis is an important physiological process for the development and regulation of tissue homeostasis\\[[@pone.0179137.ref002]\\]. Apoptosis ensures a balance between cellular proliferation and turnover in all types of tissues. Tubular epithelial cell damage and death is a critical event in AKI. When the degree of kidney injury is mild, the damaged tissue will normally be repaired; however, excessive cell death may lead to irreparable kidney damage and renal fibrosis. It is known that activation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway can protect cells from excessive apoptosis\\[[@pone.0179137.ref003]\\].\n\nTissue fibrosis is epidemiologically associated with the subsequent development of tissue injury"

The dysmorphic features include scoliosis (curvature of the spine), clinodactyly (permanent lateral or medial curve of a finger or toe), wide-set eyes, low set or slanted ears, small jaw, and broad forehead \\[[@B1]\\]. Mutations in the human *KCNJ2* gene, which encodes the potassium inwardly rectifying channel (I~K1~) subunit, have been associated with the disorder. The *KCNJ2* gene is expressed in the heart, brain, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and the eyes \\[[@B2]--[@B4]\\]. In the heart, the I~K1~ channel is involved in the resting phase of the cardiac action potential (AP) cycle.\n\nThe KCNJ2 protein consists of two transmembrane domains encompassing a selective pore region.

A better comprehension of immunoregulation in human VL may be useful both for designing and evaluating immunoprophylaxis.\n\nLeishmaniases present a wide spectrum of manifestations, with either tegumentary or visceral involvement. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a progressive infection with fatal outcome in the absence of treatment. During disease evolution there is extensive parasite multiplication attaining a high parasite burden in the spleen and liver.

Although THA is reportedly superior to BHA in terms of hip pain, function and reoperation rate, THA has a higher rate of dislocation \\[[@R2], [@R3]\\]. The direct anterior approach (DAA) to the hip joint is an intermuscular and inter-neural approach without muscle transection and detachment \\[[@R4], [@R5]\\].

"Introduction\n============\n\nCadmium is a potentially toxic heavy metal, which has entered agricultural soils via atmospheric deposition and fertilization with manure, phosphates, and sewage sludge ([@B45]). In humans, Cd is ingested via contaminated food, and it is genotoxic and cytotoxic, inhibits cell growth, and induces apoptosis ([@B32]; [@B47]). Cd is efficiently accumulated in the kidneys, where it has a biological half-life of 10--30 years, and thus, the Cd burden in the body increases with age ([@B11]). Plant roots can readily absorb and translocate Cd to the shoots. It is, therefore, necessary for food safety and human health to reduce Cd accumulation in edible plant parts and minimize human dietary Cd intake. Rapeseed (*Brassica napus* L., 2*n* = 38, AACC) is a vegetable and an important source of edible oil. The Cd distribution in rapeseed organs is in the following decreasing order: leaves \\> stems \\> roots \\> pods \\> seeds ([@B2]). In addition, rapeseed Cd content tends to increase with soil Cd levels ([@B39]). For this reason, it is preferable to select and cultivate rapeseed accessions that accumulate low Cd concentrations.\n\nA report on soil environmental quality in China indicated that 16% of the arable land is polluted, and 7%"

"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. DR is a common complication of diabetes, the incidence of which is rapidly increasing worldwide[@b1]. Conventionally, DR has been considered as a microcirculatory disease of the retina. However, emerging evidence has shown that retinal degeneration by apoptosis is an early event in DR. In fact, neural apoptosis is one of the most important histological features of DR[@b2]. Indeed, diabetes related apoptosis was detected in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)[@b1], and RGC loss has been found in both diabetic patients with no microcirculatory defect[@b3][@b4][@b5] and STZ-induced diabetic rats[@b6].

This increase in consumer popularity has resulted in an expansion of its planting scale around the world in recent years. However, the low germination rate and seedling vigor of sweet corn seed still limit the development of the sweet corn industry to some extent \\[[@B3-sensors-18-01010]\\]. Its high soluble sugar content and lower starch content are thought to be the main reasons that sweet corn seeds deteriorate rapidly compared to field corn seeds, especially during the storage process \\[[@B4-sensors-18-01010],[@B5-sensors-18-01010],[@B6-sensors-18-01010],[@B7-sensors-18-01010]\\].

Bone loss results from bone resorption by osteoclasts exceeding bone formation by osteoblasts, and is generally accompanied by an increased bone turnover rate \\[[@CR2]\\]. This progressive skeletal disease increases susceptibility to fractures, and thus causes high morbidity and mortality.\n\nBisphosphonates, synthetic pyrophosphate analogs, have physicochemical effects similar to those of pyrophosphates \\[[@CR3]\\]. Bisphosphonates can modulate osteoclasts and promote apoptosis to decrease bone turnover rate \\[[@CR4], [@CR5]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nTo some extent, a neural system can be viewed as an information processing system, where information from the environment is encoded by the system and then processed by another. Many neural encoding schemes are proposed, among which firing rate coding scheme has been extensively explored. Neural tuning curves, or stimulus-response curves, are often used to model the input-output relationship of neurons, where the neural coding scheme is usually rate coding. To construct such models, one needs to collect the firing rates of an isolated neuron presented by given inputs. The neuron is then treated as a \"black box\" and is fitted using the data with a certain function, i.e., one does not need to know the details of the underlying mechanisms of the neurons; he only needs to find a function to fit the input-output data well. This raises an important question here. That is, though these tuning curves fit the input-output data of the neurons well, why real neurons process information in such a way?\n\nInformation theory (Alexander and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, [@B1]; McDonnell et al., [@B9]; Rolls and Treves, [@B15]) can be used to explain the underlying mechanisms of information processing for neural systems, which may consist"

"INTRODUCTION {#SEC1}\n============\n\nExpressing proteins at the wrong levels is a common reason why genetic designs fail. For a metabolic pathway, suboptimal enzyme concentrations could lead to problems, such as the accumulation of toxic intermediates, titration of co-factors, or overburdening the host ([@B1]--[@B5]). Similarly, when building a genetic circuit, the expression of regulatory proteins needs to be balanced in order to perform the desired computational function ([@B6],[@B7]). Across these projects, the challenge is that the correct expression levels are often not known *a priori* and, even if they were, there is uncertainty in selecting genetic parts to achieve target expression levels ([@B8],[@B9]). Further, the optimal expression of one gene often depends on the expression levels of other genes in the system, thus creating a 'rugged' search space where multiple genes have to be changed simultaneously to achieve an improvement ([@B10]--[@B13]). For these reasons, optimization often requires the creation of libraries by mutagenesis and screening.\n\nLibraries of multi-gene systems can be built using guided and unguided approaches. Many variants of a pathway can be constructed by substituting genetic parts controlling each gene; for example, promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBSs), and RNA stability elements ([@B1],[@B5],[@B14]--[@B19]).

"**Introduction:** Avascular necrosis is defined as the death of bone tissues secondary to lack of inadequate vascular supply. Its aetiology is numerous, and sometimes multifactorial, but in essence may be caused by any perturbation in bony vasculature 1. Such examples range from fracture, joint dislocation, slipped and epiphysis, to more complex diseases such as sickle cell anaemia, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Furthermore, exogenous causes such as alcohol abuse or corticosteroid administration 1,2 are also apparent, although with a caveat that in 25% of cases the cause remains unknown. All in all, this in turn leads to bone necrosis, which subsequently may lead to osteochondritis dissecans, should articular joint cartilage become involved. The most common affected sites are the following 3: 1) head of femur; 2) neck of talus or 3) scaphoid 1,2.

"Introduction\n============\n\nCorals are animals that live in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus *Symbiodinium* as well as a rich bacterial community among other microorganisms that are collectively referred to as the coral holobiont ([@b39]). A coral\\'s associated microbial community contributes fundamentally to the holobiont\\'s functioning due to its role in coral nutrition ([@b23]) and host defense ([@b37]; [@b20]; [@b36]). Coral diseases are considered one of the most destructive local and geographical forces that impact corals and are responsible for major reef ecosystem declines over the past decades ([@b49]; [@b51]; [@b55]; [@b53]; [@b15]; [@b27]).\n\nCoral disease is defined as any abnormal condition affecting the coral holobiont ([@b42]), often described as a progressive loss of coral tissue due to viral, fungal, protozoan, or bacterial infections ([@b49]; [@b7]) and facilitated by environmental factors (e.g. high sea surface temperatures). It usually manifests through tissue discoloration and eventually tissue loss (necrosis).

"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nHair colouration in mammals depends on the deposition of melanins in the hair shaft as it develops within the follicle ([@bib8]). Follicular melanocytes produce black eumelanin and brown pheomelanin at differential concentrations, a process principally controlled by genetic factors, resulting in the myriad of colours and patterns seen in the natural world ([@bib9]). [@bib6] showed that the relative proportion of eumelanin and pheomelanin was controlled by activity of the enzyme tyrosinase. Lower levels of activity favour production of pheomelanin, while higher levels favour eumelanin. What is more, tyrosinase activity is stimulated by tyrosine (Tyr) concentration, with an increase leading to greater eumelanin production, as shown by [@bib13]. Tyrosine can come directly from the diet, or from the hydroxylation of phenylalanine ([@bib11]). Therefore, both amino acids are relevant in terms of dietary intake.\n\nGenerating an entirely black hair coat, as is seen in a number of canine breeds, requires virtually exclusive deposition of eumelanin. It is commonly observed however, that such an ostensibly black coat can be affected by an 'off-black' dilution, often resulting in a red hue to the hair ([@bib16]).

Therefore, understanding of genetic basis of MD and improving MD resistance in chickens are of great interest for the poultry industry and animal welfare.\n\nGenetic variations and gene expression play important roles in phenotypic diversity \\[[@B3-ijms-18-01020],[@B4-ijms-18-01020]\\]. Some of these variations may underlie major mechanisms that account for variations in disease resistance. Thus, the identification of these variations and potential genetic markers is important for better understanding of disease resistance, as well as for genomic predication and marker-assisted selection.

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a genetic disorder transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\]. Patients develop multiple adenomatous polyps in the colon varying from a hundred to thousands in number. If left, these polyps will invariably transform, through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, to colorectal malignancy \\[[@CR3]--[@CR5]\\]. Therefore early diagnosis and appropriate treatment is essential. Patients may develop extra intestinal manifestations such as congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), sebaceous cysts (51%), desmoids tumours (26%), and in lesser proportions, osteomas, lipomas (Gardner's syndrome ) and extra intestinal malignancies; hepatomas, retinoblastomas and brain tumours (Turcot's syndrome) \\[[@CR6]--[@CR9]\\]. FAP is also associated with the presence of polyps in the upper gastro intestinal tract in 90 to 100 percent \\[[@CR7], [@CR8]\\]. Familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, a tumour suppressor gene, located in the long arm of chromosome 5 \\[[@CR10]--[@CR12]\\].

Introduction {#sec1-molecules-16-02551}\n===============\n\nMedicinal plants are viewed as important sources of new drugs since they contain numerous compounds with significant pharmacological potential, many of which may serve as lead compounds in the development of new drugs. Consequently, it is important to be able to separate and identify these bioactive compounds, but traditional separation methods have several drawbacks: (1) they primarily target major components; (2) minor components might be lost during the separation procedure; (3) bioactive components may be deactivated.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant subtype, which is further divided based on histological growth pattern. The two major NSCLC histological subtypes are adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC)^[@CR2]^. Large-cell lung carcinoma (LCC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) are less common but represent important differential diagnoses. Histological assessment of lung cancer is clinically important, since histological subtype can affect clinical management regarding, e.g., choice of therapy^[@CR3]--[@CR5]^. Standard diagnostic procedures in histological subtyping include assessment of microscopic morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of protein marker expression.

"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a pediatric self-limited vasculitis that is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in the US and Japan[@b1][@b2].

It is expected that the seawater pH will decrease 0.3--0.4 units relative to present values before the year 2100 (Caldeira and Wickett [@b8]; Feely et al. [@b13]).

However, changing the behaviors of parents can be notoriously challenging ([@B37]). One potential reason for this is that parents' beliefs about their children, and their own roles in shaping their children's development, may be incompatible with the goals of these interventions. For instance, parents may be reluctant to talk frequently with their very young children, a frequently targeted goal in parent-focused early intervention activities (e.g., [@B23]) if they do not understand that this is a mechanism through which language development occurs ([@B33]).\n\nRecent research has focused on parents' mindsets as a key factor that may shape parenting behaviors and potentially moderate the success of parent-focused interventions (e.g., [@B33]).

However, abiotic stresses such as salinity, high temperatures and drought are main factors that reduce crop growth and yield, in large areas of the world ([@B53]; [@B43]). Globally, abiotic stress, such as salinity is a crucial hurdle preventing the increase of crop production in growing areas ([@B48]; [@B83]). Globally, approximately 20% of irrigated agricultural land is under salt stress, as reported by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) ([@B51]; [@B61]).

"Actinic keratoses (AKs) are dysplastic epidermal lesions that occur in fair-skinned individuals who have been chronically exposed to sunlight. Actinic keratoses are usually found on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, bald scalp, forearms, and backs of hands. Individual AKs are identified as scaly, rough, skin color to red, pinpoint to larger patch lesions that may disappear and reappear over months or years. Actinic keratoses are considered to be precancerous lesions with the potential to progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Results of a previous study suggest that AKs may give rise to nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) at a greater rate than previously acknowledged.^[@R1]^ Criscione and colleagues^[@R1]^ found that the risk of progression of AK to primary SCC was 0.6% at 1 year and 2.57% at 4 years; in addition, approximately 65% of all primary SCCs diagnosed during the trial arose in lesions that had earlier been clinically diagnosed as AKs. The cellular damage and atypia seen at the histologic level of AKs are similar to those of surrounding nonlesional skin,^[@R2],[@R3]^ suggesting that skin surrounding AKs may also be at increased risk of skin cancer.\n\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) using a 20% topical solution of aminolevulinic acid HCl (ALA, Levulan Kerastick;"

However, the desired wide use of these therapeutic agents and that of emerging ones such as gene and cell-based therapies, may be impeded by their immunogenicity, i.e., their capacity to induce an immune response in a proportion of treated patients. This immune response, characterized by the development of specific anti-drug antibodies (ADA), can ultimately lead to loss of treatment efficacy through inhibition of the agent activity or accelerated clearance and safety issues, some of them provoking patient death.^[1](#CIT0001)--[4](#CIT0004)^ In this context, regulatory agencies in charge of granting market authorization require the immunogenicity risk to be thoroughly explored and characterized, and have provided sponsors with specific guidelines on ADA assays and immunogenicity risk assessment for biologics of various types.^[5](#CIT0005)--[9](#CIT0009)^ Consequently, scientists and clinicians developing biologics are faced with the challenge of conducting trustworthy immunogenicity risk assessments, accurately measuring ADA levels, estimating their clinical relevance and impact on safety and efficacy, and correctly reporting immunogenicity data in regulatory dossiers.

INTRODUCTION {#ece34633-sec-0001}\n===============\n\nCharacterizing individual variability in population dynamic rates is an important consideration in ecological studies. For example, age\u2010dependent survival is an integral aspect of population dynamics (Chaozhi, Ovaskainen, Saastamoinen, & Hanski, [2007](#ece34633-bib-0010){ref-type=\"ref\"}; McCrea, Morgan, & Cole, [2013](#ece34633-bib-0026){ref-type=\"ref\"}). In many species, survival rates can vary by orders of magnitude across all age classes, or can change markedly at various life\u2010history stages. This correlation between age and survival is likely linked to size, as older individuals tend to be larger and less vulnerable to predation. On the other hand, all animal species have a life span that is limited by aging rather than extrinsic factors (P\u00e9ron et\u00a0al., [2010](#ece34633-bib-0028){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Understanding this variation in survivorship across ages can provide information on population dynamics such as the proportion of new recruits that will survive to reproductive age, impacts of management interventions on population dynamics, and how to target harvesting efforts to maximize sustainability (Berkeley, Hixon, Larson, & Love, [2004](#ece34633-bib-0004){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nOur motivation for wanting to understand size and age\u2010related survival came from a study"

"Introduction\n============\n\nOxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense and may lead to oxidative damage. Excess production of ROS, and other radicals have been implicated as inducers of tissue injury in several pathological conditions including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease and Alzheimer dementias, diabetes, ischemic reperfusion injuries, rheumatoid arthritis and even the process of aging.[@R1] However, humans have evolved highly complex antioxidant protection mechanisms that function interactively and synergically to neutralize free radicals.

"1. Introduction {#sec1-ijms-21-03817}\n===============\n\nErythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone mainly expressed by peritubular fibroblasts in the renal cortex. EPO secretion is regulated by hemoglobin (Hgb) levels and tissue oxygenation (pO~2~) in the outer medulla of the kidney. The synthesis of EPO is regulated at the transcriptional level, i.e., a low tissue pO~2~ leads to up-regulation of EPO synthesis and consequent stimulation of erythrocyte production. Erythropoiesis is a slow-acting process, following a rise in plasma EPO, it takes 3--4 days before reticulocytes (immature red cells) become apparent \\[[@B1-ijms-21-03817],[@B2-ijms-21-03817],[@B3-ijms-21-03817]\\].\n\nThe normal concentration of EPO in rat plasma is about 25 U/l.

It has been long recognized by clinicians that, while low Hgb levels lead to anemia, excessive Hgb levels can increase mortality as a result of cardiovascular and thromboembolic events. Hence, the regulation of EPO dosing is a major concern and effective mathematical methods are being developed to determine the appropriate dose of EPO to maintain the target Hgb levels \\[[@B7-ijms-21-03817],[@B8-ijms-21-03817]\\]."
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nChemical defence is one of the mechanisms that organisms use to enhance their survival prospects. Several different animal taxa from arthropods [@pone.0068862-Roth1]--[@pone.0068862-Nishida1] to amphibians [@pone.0068862-Daly1] defend themselves against predators, parasites and/or competitors by producing deterrent or noxious substances [@pone.0068862-Dumbacher1]. Within amphibians, poison frogs that sequester alkaloids from their prey to be chemically protected are the best known example [@pone.0068862-Daly1]. In other groups, such as endothermal tetrapods, however, examples of chemically defended animals are limited to a small number of lineages [@pone.0068862-Savitzky1]. Indeed, birds have not been included in lists of chemically-defended animals until the end of the twentieth century [@pone.0068862-Dumbacher1], when species of the genus *Pitohui* were found to deter predators and/or parasites by means of the neurotoxin homobatrachotoxin that is contained in their tissues [@pone.0068862-Dumbacher2]. Apart from this extreme example of poisonous *Pitohuis*, several other bird species also contain toxic or unpalatable compounds that may help to defend them (see reviews in [@pone.0068862-Dumbacher1], [@pone.0068862-Hagelin1]).

Bucillamine, as well as MTX, is known to cause interstitial pneumonia ([@B1]-[@B18]). Pre-existing interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a risk factor for MTX-induced pneumonitis, and MTX-induced pneumonitis often shows a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) pattern, resulting in fatal outcomes in some patients ([@B19]-[@B22]).

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nResearchers have recently focused on different modes of non-verbal communication concerning interpersonal coordination (e.g., mimicry, gestures, and facial expressions) as a basis of social interaction (Vicaria and Dickens, [@B36]). These kinds of nonverbal behavior can cause spatiotemporal coordination and support affective entrainment between two or more individuals (Phillips-Silver and Keller, [@B25]). Although it can be helpful to verbally share action plans and strategies, verbal communication might be too slow when one needs to instantly react to others\\' actions on a joint task (Knoblich and Jordan, [@B16]). Even in basic communication, concerning mother-child-dyads, it is important that two individuals immediately mediate information to drive entrainment (Phillips-Silver and Keller, [@B25]). Nonverbal communication can be realized via a broad spectrum of perceptual modalities, like visual, kinesthetic, tactile, or auditory systems, to support emergent coordination (Marsh et al., [@B21]). For example, Waterhouse et al. ([@B38]) reported that two dancers nonverbally coordinated during their choreography performance. They synchronized the same movements or aligned the onset of different movements, relying on visual cues from their body movement as well as on auditory cues from breath and stepping sounds.\n\nCommonly, if the amount of information is enhanced within a certain perceptual modality, interpersonal coordination"

However, during the pathological conditions such as premature ovarian failure (POF), there is an accelerated depletion of primordial follicles [@pone.0039034-BeckPeccoz1], [@pone.0039034-Jagarlamudi1].

Gene disruption studies involving PARP have identified various roles of PARP in cellular responses to DNA damage. *Parp*-/- mice are resistant to DNA damage induced cell death suggesting the involvement of PARP in cell death through NAD^+^depletion \\[[@B1]\\]. PARP is a DNA damage sensor which upon binding to damaged sites triggers transfer of long, linear or branched chains of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) onto various nuclear acceptor proteins, including itself at the expense of NAD^+^\\[[@B2]\\]. PARP is also a mediator of cell death after ischemia, reperfusion injury and exposure to various DNA damaging agents \\[[@B3]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nHFMD, caused by enteroviruses, is a common illness in children who are less than 5 years old. HFMD has currently emerged as a major infectious disease in China, affecting about one million children annually [@pone.0051957-Tan1]--[@pone.0051957-Xu1]. Currently, there is neither a prophylactic vaccine nor antiviral therapy to treat the disease. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of HFMD and the potential cross-reactive immunity to other viral infections and vaccines may assist in developing a novel therapy or effective vaccine against HFMD.\n\nThe major etiological agents of HFMD are enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus (CV) A16 [@pone.0051957-Zhu1], [@pone.0051957-Rabenau1], and other enteroviruses including CV serotypes A2, A4, A6, A9, A10, B1, B3 and B5, also cause mild HFMD [@pone.0051957-Fujimoto1]--[@pone.0051957-Park1]. EV71 is the most pathogenic virus of these causative agents, causing severe HFMD with complications including brainstem encephalitis, severe pulmonary edema, and significant mortality [@pone.0051957-Chong1], [@pone.0051957-Huang1].\n\nSeveral studies suggest that the cellular immune response plays an important role in controlling EV71 infection. First, the level of antibody against EV71 does not correlate with disease severity [@pone.0051957-Yang1], [@pone.0051957-Chang1].

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nAtom probe tomography (APT) is a powerful technique that is able to determine both the three-dimensional (3D) structure and elemental composition of materials with atomic resolution across many disciplines \\[[@CR1]--[@CR9]\\] APT analysis commonly involves the use of a dual beam scanning electron microscope/focused ion beam (FIB/SEM) \\[[@CR10]\\] to prepare samples in a compatible geometry. Moving prepared specimens from the FIB/SEM to the atom probe typically requires the specimen to be transferred between instruments under ambient conditions. However, for specimens that are sensitive to air (i.e., oxygen, water, etc.) or thermal exposure, it is imperative to insure environmental protection during the entire transfer process so that all specimens are maintained in a pristine state before, during, and after analysis. The first part, before analysis, is critical for future cryogenic APT developments enabling broader applications in biology, polymer, and organic chemistry. The latter part, after analysis, is critical for future time-resolved studies such as APT analysis of nanoscale catalyst materials in one state then undergoing oxidation/reduction and then analyzing the same sample in a second state.\n\nOne approach for controlled transfer is to utilize a shuttle device, a *suitcase* if you will, in which specimens are transported between the"

"Due to its high economic and scientific value, the genus *Morchella* Dill. ex Pers.: Fr. has become a hot research topic in China and abroad in recent years. Based on the recent research achievements, we present a review of its taxonomy, phylogeny, species and ecological diversity, geographical distribution and biogeography, artificial cultivation, and genome.\n\n1.. Economic importance of morels {#S0002}\n=================================\n\nTrue morels (*Morchella* spp.) belong to the Pezizales, *Morchellaceae* (Hibbett et al. [2007](#CIT0025)), with *Morchella esculenta* (L.) Pers. as the type species. They are mostly distributed in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere where they typically fruit for only a few weeks each spring. Due to their desirable \ufb02avor and short fruiting season, morels become the world's most prized edible fungi. To meet the demand created by their growing popularity, wild morels, the main source of edible morels, are harvested commercially and exported extensively from China, India, Turkey, Mexico, and the United States (Pilz et al. [2007](#CIT0042)). In China, the annual export of dried morels increased \ufb01vefold from 181,000 kg to 900,000\u00a0kg over the past 5\u00a0years, averaging \\$160\u00a0US dollars per kilogram.\n\n2..

"Construction codes (building, fire, energy, plumbing, and electrical) are critical drivers of the built environment. They provide normative standards by which buildings are designed, built, altered, inspected, and assessed. Regulated at national and provincial/state levels, and enforced at provincial/state and local levels, these technically detailed codes offer passive protection for the population. Public health proponents have successfully advocated for improvements to fire codes, yielding better sprinkler systems, the use of fire walls and improved routes of egress, all contributing to reductions in burns and fatalities (U.S. Fire Administration, [@CR14]; Licht, [@CR9]). However, public health has paid less attention to building codes.\n\nWhile a number of health issues can be tackled through building codes (World Health Organization, [@CR15]), this commentary focuses on preventing falls and injuries involving stairs and bathrooms. Stair- and bathtub/shower-related falls ranked first and eighth, respectively, among the top 10 consumer products in the United States involved in non-fatal injury costs (Consumer Product Safety Commission, [@CR3]). For 2009--2010, the annual incidence of non-fatal injuries related to stairs exceeded 1.23 million persons, while for bathtubs/showers, it was estimated to be nearly 263,000 people. The total estimated annual direct and indirect costs for stair-related non-fatal injuries exceeded US \\$92 billion"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nIdentifying neural circuitry controlling specific behaviors requires the ability to communicate with specific neurons in the brains of awake, freely moving animals. The most established interface is electrodes implanted in the brain. They provide rapid neuronal stimulation and recording, however, at the cost of being invasive and with limited spatial and cell type targeting. Optogenetics, visible light-based stimulation of neurons genetically engineered to express light-gated channels and ion pumps, provides genetic targeting of specific cell types in combination with rapid stimulation ([@bib6]; [@bib9]). The method quickly gained popularity and has been used in various animal models to study brain circuits associated with Parkinson's Disease ([@bib16]; [@bib25]), addictive behavior ([@bib12]; [@bib43]), depression ([@bib36]; [@bib55]) and anxiety ([@bib46]). However, optogenetics requires permanent brain implants to guide the light into the brain, and typically, an optical fiber, tethering the animal to the light source. A third approach, pharmacological neuromodulation using Designer GPCRs Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), provides a tetherless alternative to optogenetics, but generates a much slower response, ranging from tens of minutes to hours, as the drug must diffuse to the location of action ([@bib3]; [@bib47]).

"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\n*Durvillaea* is a genus within the Phaeophyceae (Stramenopiles, Fucales) that comprises 6 species, all of them living in the intertidal or subtidal rocky habitats in the southern hemisphere, mainly with a sub-antarctic distribution ([@R10]; [@R17]). Particularly in Chile there are two genetically different *Durvillaea* entities: the provisionally called \"*continental clade\"* (30\u00b0S to 44\u00b0S), and *Durvillaea antarctica* \"*sub-antarctic clade*\" from 49\u00b0S southward, which is also present in the Falkland Islands, several sub-antarctic islands and New Zealand ([@R9]). *Durvillaea* species commonly known as bull kelps are large, eye-catching organisms in marine habitats where they fulfil key ecological roles for coastal marine communities ([@R4]; [@R44]). As primary producers, bull kelp forests play a vital role in marine trophic networks, function as microhabitat, nursery and substratum for a number of organisms. Because of their size they are also significant for the understory flora and fauna, providing refuge for numerous organisms ([@R43]). Bull kelps also play an important role in spreading the macroscopic and microscopic lifeforms associated with them ([@R22]). After individual kelps get detached they can -- under the right circumstances -- stay alive for a prolonged period of time (overall around 1 month) and travel over hundreds of kilometres ([@R8];"

With manual tractography, a fiber tract is localized first by selecting specific regions of interest (ROI) that are thought to be along the course of the intended white matter tract. These ROIs are defined by anatomical reference points, and it is from these regions that white matter fiber tracts are derived. Consequently, manual tractography is limited by its prolonged workflow, user bias, and anatomical distortions which may further compound human error \\[[@REF2]\\]. This is problematic because the applicability of tractography for a neurosurgeon is to help identify essential white matter tracts"
"1. Background {#s0005}\n=============\n\nWith increasing demand for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and related approaches replacing numerous yet openly performed procedures, training capacities are needed to ensure each surgeon's skills are adequate prior to patient contact. This training needs to be more efficient and apprehensible as well, since MIS comes with natural obstacles and psychomotor demands additional to those one faces when performing open surgery. Consequently, many centers and universities worldwide provide specific laparoscopic training courses and research is conducted to optimize training [@b0005], [@b0010], [@b0015], [@b0020].\n\nE-learning has been shown to be a valuable asset to laparoscopic training; our group continuously conducts research for further evaluation [@b0025], [@b0030], [@b0035]. Since computer games are believed to be a commonplace to today's students and their experience potentially enables them to profit from different approaches, the concept of 'Serious Gaming' is subject to training research [@b0040].

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nThe introduction of circulating prostate specific antigen (PSA) test has increased the rate of diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) by as much as 50%. However, the majority of PCa patients diagnosed through PSA screening present with low-risk, localized, Gleason score (GS) 6 tumors. Although PSA has a high negative predictive value (NPV) for PCa, its lack of specificity, limited impact on reducing morbidity, and the harms of over-diagnosing indolent disease have raised concerns about PSA screening \\[[@CR1]\\].\n\nTo reduce overtreatment and associated morbidity, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently recommended against PSA screening to prevent unnecessary biopsies of \"clinically insignificant\" PCa (CI-PCa) which included patients with benign and low-risk disease \\[[@CR1]\\]. However, following these recommendations, there was a substantial decrease (42.9%) \\[[@CR2]\\] in the detection of GS \u2265\u20097 disease, indicating the reduction in PSA screening could delay diagnosis of \"clinically significant\" PCa (CS-PCa) consisting of intermediate- and high-risk disease.

However, their impact on the diagnosis of CS-PCa is currently unknown.\n\nSeveral nomograms have been developed to estimate PCa aggressiveness following biopsy, such as the well-established"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nHigh levels of glycolytic flux are essential to maintain the required physiological output during combat exercise ([@B1]), although a concomitant fall in both muscle and blood pH and bicarbonate ion concentration \\[$\\text{HCO}_{3}^{-}$\\] eventually occurs ([@B2]). This is due to the increases in hydrogen ion (H^+^) accumulation, which in turn, disturb the state of equilibrium between acidity and alkalinity of body fluids (i.e., acid base balance). Such an alteration is known as metabolic acidosis and has been associated with fatigue by reducing or impairing the release of calcium ions (Ca^2+^) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ([@B3]), impeding glycolytic enzyme activity ([@B4]), and altering the strong ion difference leading to reduced action potentials and muscle excitability ([@B5]). The typical daily regimen for a competitive boxer often consists of two sessions comprised of an initial high-intensity intermittent running session followed by a boxing-specific session that mimics the demands of competition, interspersed within a short recovery period ([@B6]). Subsequently a large degree of metabolic acidosis is likely evident in the subsequent bout of exercise, therefore mitigation of the deleterious effects between sessions are prudent to investigate.\n\nPre-exercise ingestion of 0.3 g.kg^\u22121^ body mass (BM) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO~3~) can lead to an approximate"

"Introduction\n============\n\nIn high-income countries, growing numbers of men as well as women are choosing to postpone parenthood. On average, both parents conceive their first child at an older age.[@dys236-B1]^,^[@dys236-B2] If sustained, this demographic shift may have manifold implications for the health of successive generations. We discuss here the evidence for a beneficial effect of increasing paternal age at conception (PAC) on the health of descendants.\n\nBasic genetics offers a strong foundation for hypothesizing that increased PAC creates an increased risk for a host of disorders in offspring. *In utero*, the female germ cells undergo an estimated 22 cell divisions before meiosis and two divisions during meiosis. However, as only one chromosome replication takes place during meiosis, the female germ cells undergo a total of 23 chromosome replications. Postnatally, the meiotic process is arrested at the first meiosis and this persists until puberty. Thus, between the mother\\'s birth and the conception of her offspring, her germ cells undergo no chromosome replication and only one cell division (regardless of her age at conception).[@dys236-B3] In contrast, spermatogenesis goes on throughout most of the male's life course. For instance, the estimated cumulative numbers of germ-line stem cell (GSC) replications in men by the"

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the underlying pathological process of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and cardiomyopathy (CM) [@B001]. As a leading cause of death worldwide [@B002], IHD (also known as coronary artery disease) is primarily caused by acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A precursor to heart failure, CM is acutely caused by myocardial ischemia and chronically by hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Mitochondrial damage occurs primarily during the reperfusion phase of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) [@B003], [@B004]. In the post-I/R heart, mitochondrial dysfunctions are due to inhibition of electron transport chain (ETC) function and oxygen (O~2~) consumption, mitochondrial calcium (Ca^2\uff0b^) overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore opening, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (*\u0394*\u03a8m), and increased mitochondrial necrosis and apoptosis [@B005]-[@B007]. Alteration of mitochondrial energy metabolism also plays a substantial role in IHD and CM [@B008].

"Background\n==========\n\nDiabetes mellitus, which can cause chronic, progressive disorders of multiple organs or systems, increases rapidly in recent years. As one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus, diabetic cardiomyopathy is defined as the left ventricle (LV) dysfunction independent of the coronary artery disease and hypertension \\[[@B1]\\]. In the early stage, diabetic cardiomyopathy can be characterized by the LV diastolic dysfunction, while LV systolic function impairs in the subsequent clinical course of diabetes \\[[@B2]\\]. However, currently the diagnosis of diabetic cardiomyopathy is difficult for clinical treatment due to the lack of any pathognomonic histologic changes or imaging characteristics.\n\nEchocardiography, as a reference standard to estimate the cardiac function, is frequently used for the diagnosis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Especially in recent years, Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) echocardiography has been considered as a new sensitive technique for the evaluation of diastolic function, based on the measurement of wall motion velocities \\[[@B3]\\]. Therein, LV mass, LV volume, ejection fraction (EF), transmitral early (E wave) diastolic velocity, transmitral late (A wave) diastolic velocity, and their ratio (E/A ratio) *etc*. are always clinically measured to evaluate the cardiac function, but these indicators do not directly reflect information of complex regional myocardial motion and sometimes"

It is secreted into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid by the pineal gland, and is produced locally by other tissues within the body, such as the retina [@pone.0090056-Tosini1]. In mammals, melatonin signals through two receptors of the G-protein-coupled super-family, termed MT1 and MT2 [@pone.0090056-Dubocovich1]. Compared to adults, foetuses and neonates exhibit a more widespread receptor distribution, suggesting that melatonin may have as yet unknown roles in development [@pone.0090056-Davis1]. Surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms controlling these developmental changes in melatonin signalling.\n\nPineal melatonin production is driven by the master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus and thus exhibits a robust daily rhythm. This rhythm varies in proportion to the length of the night and so melatonin encodes both daily and seasonal time [@pone.0090056-Reiter2].

The system can rapidly turn \"off\" regulatory proteins with high selectivity and is essential for numerous cellular processes such as transcription, signaling, DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle progression and differentiation. Not surprisingly, defects in the ubiquitin-proteolytic system have been implicated in a number of human diseases including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders [@pgen.1003375-Welcker1]--[@pgen.1003375-Lee1].\n\nAn enzymatic cascade of three enzymes mediates the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate protein: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-ligase (E3) [@pgen.1003375-Ye1].

"A 40-year-old woman developed erythematous, raised and pruritic, migratory lesions on a daily basis affecting her whole body for the past 3 months; the appearance of the rash was consistent with urticaria. There was associated angioedema affecting her lips and face. Her medical history was significant for MS, diagnosed 9 years before, manifesting clinically with mobility, speech, and cognitive impairment. Initial treatment was with \u03b2-interferon and glatiramer acetate; however, disease relapse prompted switching to alemtuzumab, with 2 standard courses given 12 months apart (60 and 36 mg, respectively, the last dose given 12 months before the onset of rash), and achieved remission with a new baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale of 2.\n\nAncillary history includes short-lived, asymptomatic, subclinical hypothyroidism before 13 years for which she was given thyroxine during pregnancy. Months after her first dose of alemtuzumab, she developed mild symptomatic hyperthyroidism with persistent thyroglobulin antibodies. Carbimazole was given for a year but ceased after her thyroid function tests normalized. She remained persistently thyroglobulin antibody seropositive. No other subsequent secondary autoimmune diseases manifested with otherwise normal laboratory results.\n\nAt the time of development of urticaria, she was on long-term venlafaxine and dexamphetamine for a mood disorder.

"1. Introduction {#s0005}\n===============\n\nDNA methylation studies have been traditionally concerned with 5-methylcytosine (5mC), mostly in the context of CpG dinucleotides, which until recently was the only epigenetic modification of DNA with known biological function. The rediscovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in mammalian DNA has opened up an exciting new area of epigenetic research concerning the potential role of 5hmC in both normal development and disease progression [@b0005; @b0010]. 5hmC has been proposed to be an intermediate in an active DNA demethylation pathway and may also be a stable epigenetic modification in its own right, contributing unique regulatory functions to the epigenome [@b0015].\n\nCurrent methods for profiling 5hmC at a genome-wide level rely largely on sequencing-based protocols that are both costly and time-consuming. In addition, they require a high degree of expertise with the chosen assay for successful implementation. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is a widely-used, robust and reliable tool for DNA methylation profiling [@b0020; @b0025], suitable for high-throughput sample processing and is therefore the platform of choice for current epigenome-wide association studies [@b0030; @b0035]. The 450K array interrogates over 480,000\u00a0CpG sites in the human genome, making it an appropriate tool for 5hmC detection as this modification has been reported"
"Background\n==========\n\nIn September 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proffered their revised recommendations for HIV testing in health care settings \\[[@B1]\\]. Since the release of these recommendations, there has been much discussion in the lay, medical, and public health literature as to whether these recommendations are morally problematic \\[[@B2]-[@B31]\\]. Through a review of both the CDC's recommendations and the commentaries on this topic in the lay and medical literature, we identified seven major elements or changes, either explicit in the recommendations themselves or implied by them, which were viewed by some as potentially morally troublesome. These changes were: (1) an opt-out approach to screening, (2) no separate signed consent for HIV testing, (3) optional prevention counseling at the time of testing, (4) nontargeted screening, (5) making HIV screening similar to screening for other treatable conditions, (6) increasing HIV screening without assured additional funding for linkage to care, and (7) making patients bear the costs of increased HIV screening in health care settings.\n\nThe first three of these recommendations -- an opt-out approach, no separate signed consent for HIV testing, and optional prevention counseling at the time of testing -- called for changes in how health care"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nGlioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the deadliest tumor of the central nervous system and, due to its location, aggressive biological behavior and diffuse infiltrative growth, presents disproportionately high morbidity and mortality. The cornerstone of therapy consists of maximal well-tolerated surgical resection followed by radiotherapy plus concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) \\[[@CR1]\\]. Despite this optimized treatment schedule, GBM is characterized by high rates of recurrences, therefore the median patient survival ranges from 12 to 15\u2009months, where less than 5% of patients survive for more than 5\u2009years after diagnosis \\[[@CR1]\\]. Moreover, since GBM is characterized by diffusely infiltrative growth and unusual ability in repairing the therapy-induced damages, a complete eradication can be exploited quite rarely \\[[@CR2]\\], which ultimately leads to a high rate of recurrences characterized by increased aggressiveness. Systemic therapy with TMZ, though with its limitations, remains the standard of care for GBM, but the frequent onset of chemoresistance in relapsed GBM generates a compelling need for novel therapeutic strategies. Of note, there is presently no valid alternative to the aforementioned single-drug approach using TMZ in concomitance of radiotherapy or alone in the adjuvant treatment.\n\nSI113, a small molecule identified by virtual screening of a"
"Introduction\n============\n\nIn higher plants, cell-to-cell polar auxin transport (PAT) of the phytohormone auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), generates maxima and minima that direct growth and development ([@bib2]; [@bib30]; [@bib27]; [@bib12]; [@bib19]). Although IAA is present in all plant phyla ([@bib4]; [@bib11]), including members of the Charophyta such as *Nitella* species ([@bib22]), PAT has only been detected in land plants, the earliest being the Bryophytes ([@bib10]) and most PAT studies have been done in angiosperms and predominantly in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. These studies indicate that, in angiosperms, auxin is produced in the young developing aerial organs and in shoot apical and root meristems, and also that IAA is transported from shoots to roots by files of specialized parenchyma cells in the vasculature. These transport cells express several classes of auxin influx- and efflux-supporting proteins ([@bib29]; [@bib20]). Among the influx carriers are members of the AUXIN RESISTANT1/LIKE AUX (AUX1/LAX) proteins, while members of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) and MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE/P-GLYCOPROTEIN ABCD (ABCB/PGP) class are involved in auxin flux out of cells. Auxin efflux can be impaired by specific PAT inhibitors such as 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA).\n\nIn the Chlorophyta unicellular green algae, ABCB/PGP members have been identified by genome analysis, but these algae have no"

Bacterial chemoreceptors represent a versatile model system to study the subcellular localization of macromolecules, as they are present in many prokaryotes where they form highly ordered arrays that occupy different positions in cells. Chemoreceptors, also called Methyl-accepting Chemotaxis Proteins (MCP), are capable of transducing external signals to downstream signaling pathways where phospho-cascades, initiating at the level of histine kinases CheAs and culminating at the level of output response regulators CheYs, translate the initial signal into cell behaviors such as regulation of motility, cell development or aggregation \\[[@pgen.1007103.ref002]--[@pgen.1007103.ref004]\\]. A common feature of the MCPs is their ability to form highly ordered hexagonal structures, which, by cryoelectron tomography, look like lattices with each unit composed of an MCP trimer of dimers, two CheW docking proteins and one CheA dimer \\[[@pgen.1007103.ref005]--[@pgen.1007103.ref008]\\].

"Introduction\n============\n\nThe human *ADIPOQ* gene is located on chromo-some 3q27.3 and encodes a 244 aminoacid protein hormone with four distinct regions and the first one is a short signal sequence which targets the hormone for secretion outside the cell; next one is a short region that varies between species; the third is a 65-amino acid region with similarity to collagenous proteins; the last is a globular domain, to form these distinct regions and a number of post-translational modifications are required. It is exclusively produced by adipocytes and also froms the placenta in pregnancy and circulates high concentrations in healthy adults and is generally higher in females than males. This sexual differentiation has been attributed to the effect of testosterone on adiponectin secretion.\n\nIt is the most abundant circulating hormone secreted by the adipocytes, with putative insulin sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherosclerotic properties. In a normal pregnancy, the maternal adiponectin circulating concentration increases in the first half of the pregnancy and then decreases proportionally to weight gain and physiological insulin resistance worsening. Newborn\\'s adiponectin concentrations are higher than maternal circulating levels during pregnancy.

The success of this procedure depends on many factors, including surgical techniques and the design and material of the components. With regard to surgical techniques, implant positioning and soft tissue balancing are very important. Malpositioning of any component can lead to an increased risk of loosening, instability, and pain \\[[@B3],[@B4]\\]. Restoration of the tibiofemoral angle to within 3\u00b0 of neutral during TKA is thought to be associated with better outcome \\[[@B4]-[@B7]\\].

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nRadiation is one of the principal methods of cancer treatment, but its effectiveness is often restricted by tumor resistance and aggressiveness. Resistance and aggressiveness can be intrinsic to the tumor before radiation treatment or acquired during treatment. A defective DNA damage checkpoint is a common intrinsic factor related to radiation resistance which allows the cell to bypass DNA repair to continue growing and proliferating ([@b2-molce-42-530]). Acquired resistance and aggressiveness can develop after receiving radiation treatment in tumors that were initially sensitive but adapt to become resistant and aggressive via mutations arising during treatment or various other responses such as altered expression of the therapeutic target and activation of alternative compensatory pathways. Moreover, tumors can have a wide spectrum of genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, so radiation resistance and aggressiveness can arise through radiation-induced selection of small resistant subpopulations that become intensified. Tumors have many adaptive responses to the continuously changing tumor microenvironment during radiation treatment. Most use quick and transient epigenetic mechanisms, but genetic processes can allow tumors to stably respond to radiation and survive.\n\nAs our understanding of molecular signatures and genotypes of radiation resistant tumors has advanced, the mechanisms of resistance to radiation learned from earlier studies"

Thus, it is not surprising that unequal homologous recombination between *Alu* repeats contributes to a significant proportion of human genetic disease [@pone.0030748-Deininger1].\n\nGermline mutations in *BRCA1* predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. The 84-kb *BRCA1* locus is densely packed with repetitive elements including 138 individual *Alu* repeats that comprise 41.5% of the total sequence [@pone.0030748-Smith1].

"1 INTRODUCTION {#SEC1}\n==============\n\nAn ever increasing number of biological modeling methods depend on the assembly of accurate multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Traditionally, the main applications of sequence alignments have included phylogenetic tree reconstruction, Hidden Markov Modeling (profiles), secondary or tertiary structure prediction, function prediction and many minor but useful applications such as PCR primer design and data validation. With the notable exception of ribosomal RNA, a large majority of these applications are based on the analysis of protein sequences, possibly back-translated into nucleic acid sequences in the context of phylogenetic analysis. While this type of approaches still constitutes the vast majority of published applications for MSAs, recent biological discoveries coupled with the massive delivery of functional, structural and genomic data are rapidly expanding the potential scope of alignment methods. In order to make the best of the available data, sequence aligners will have to evolve and become able to deal with a very large number of sequences or integrate highly heterogeneous information types such as evolutionary, structural and functional data. Merely aligning all the known orthologs of a given gene will soon require aligning several thousand sequences, and the massive re-sequencing effort currently underway (Siva, [@B60]) could even mean"

The expectation of life for people reaching the age of 80 has also increased and is now 7 years for men, 9 years for women in the U.K. (OPCS data). Cardiovascular disease is the largest cause of death in this age group. As our population ages, the number of people aged 80 or over referred for cardiac surgery is increasing with a particular rise in those with aortic valve disease. There is evidence that early outcomes in heart valve surgery are improving over the last decade \\[[@B1]\\] Previous studies have demonstrated good outcomes in terms of both operative mortality \\[[@B2]\\] and quality of life \\[[@B3]\\].

"Depressive rumination, defined as \"behavior and thoughts that focus one\\'s attention on one\\'s depressive symptoms and on the implications of these symptoms\" ([@c20], p. 569) has been identified as a core process in the onset and maintenance of depression. Prospective longitudinal studies have found that self-reported depressive rumination predicts the likelihood, severity, and duration of syndromal depression ([@c21]; [@c32]).\n\nOne potential mechanism by which depressive rumination may contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression is via influencing emotional reactivity. Emotional reactivity is conceptualized as the change in the quality and intensity of affect in response to an emotionally evocative event, such as change in despondency following a failure (e.g., [@c30]; [@c53]). Experimental studies have found that induction of depressive rumination intensifies dysphoric mood, increases negative thinking, and impairs problem solving relative to distraction in individuals already in a dysphoric mood, but has no differential effect in individuals who are not already dysphoric (e.g., [@c13]; [@c22]). These findings suggest that, when there is a negative emotional response to a stressful event, depressive rumination will further exacerbate negative affect and negative thinking, whereas when there is little or no negative emotional response, rumination will have no further impact. Thus, it is"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nOn June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic outbreak of respiratory illness associated with the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (H1N1pdm). Infection with H1N1pdm was considered mild; however, the strain seemed to be highly transmissible. Based on a study in the community of La Gloria, Mexico, where the virus was first detected early in 2009, and worldwide surveillance data and mathematical modeling, the CFR was estimated to be 0.6% [@pone.0008540-Fraser1]. The first case in Argentina was reported on May 17, 2009; by July 16, 2009, just two months later, the number of cases in Argentina totaled 3056, with 137 deaths, representing a computed CFR of 4.5% [@pone.0008540-Vaillant1].\n\nAlthough we could not exclude the possibility that this elevated CFR reflected underreporting of milder infections, the alternative, a *bona fide* increase due to differences at the level of host or pathogen, might have global implications. Risk factors commonly associated with development of severe disease, including advanced age, chronic illnesses (diabetes, asthma, obesity) or immunosuppression (other immune-mediated diseases, immunomodulatory therapies, pregnancy), were not present at increased frequency in Argentina. Another potential explanation for the higher CFR was a change in the virus, including reassortment with a"

"1. Introduction {#sec0005}\n===============\n\nCytokines are a broad and loose group of small cell-signaling proteins that play important roles in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammatory response. They include interferons (IFN), interleukins (IL), chemokines, lymphokines, and tumor necrosis factors (TNF). They are produced by a variety of cells, including macrophages, B and T lymphocytes, mast cells, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and various stromal cells. Cytokines that are produced at the site of infection stimulate and coordinate innate and adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens ([@bib0135], [@bib0185], [@bib0365]). They act through their matching receptors on the surface of target cells, followed by cascades of intracellular signaling. One such frequently activated intracellular signaling is the JAK-STAT pathway, which is indispensable and pivotal in many biological processes including immunity and inflammatory response ([@bib0275], [@bib0340]). Dysregulation of JAK-STAT signaling results in immunodeficiency and immune-mediated disorders ([@bib0270], [@bib0275]). Mutations in the components of JAK-STAT pathway cause immunodeficient and autoimmune disorders ([@bib0050], [@bib0190]). Due to the importance of JAK-STAT signaling in the host immune response, it is often targeted by pathogens, including PRRSV ([@bib0290], [@bib0400], [@bib0405]).\n\nPRRSV causes a contagious disease that is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease"
"Introduction\n============\n\nThe PC12 cell line is traceable to a pheochromocytoma from the rat adrenal medulla ([@b1-ijmm-41-01-0195]--[@b4-ijmm-41-01-0195]). When exposed to nerve growth factor (NGF), PC12 cells present an observable change in sympathetic neuron phenotype and properties. Neural differentiation of PC12 has been widely used as a neuron cell model in neuroscience, such as in the nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain model ([@b5-ijmm-41-01-0195]) and nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity model ([@b6-ijmm-41-01-0195]). NGF induces differentiation of PC12 cells by acting through the TrkA receptor ([@b7-ijmm-41-01-0195]).\n\nDifferentiation of PC12 cells is assessed by semi-quantitative or quantitative morphological methods. These methods can include the measurement of the cell size, neurite number and neurite length. Additionally, neurotypic and gliotypic proteins have been used as biochemical markers of neurotoxicity ([@b8-ijmm-41-01-0195]). In general, differentiated PC12 cells have been widely used in both neurobiological and neurotoxicological studies as a model of neuronal differentiation.\n\nAt present, there are many different differentiation methods. Greene and Tischler ([@b9-ijmm-41-01-0195]) first demonstrated that PC12 cells generated in RPMI-1640 medium retained their tumorigenic properties and were sensitive to nerve growth factor protein, but the PC12 neuronal processes only reached 500--1,000 *\u03bc*m in length.

Despite routine dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and thienopyridines, the incidence of stent thrombosis persists at a rate of 0.5%--2%.[@b1-vhrm-7-399] Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis, ie, long and multiple stents, stent malapposition, residual dissection, lack of dual antiplatelet drugs, and platelet polymorphism.[@b2-vhrm-7-399],[@b3-vhrm-7-399] Resistance to acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel has been suggested as a possible cause of stent thrombosis, but conclusive data are lacking. Although low responders to clopidogrel had a significantly higher risk of major cardiovascular events (22.7% versus 5.6%), wide interindividual variability in platelet responsiveness to clopidogrel among individuals remains a topic of intense debate.[@b4-vhrm-7-399],[@b5-vhrm-7-399]\n\nProton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been advocated to lower the gastrointestinal bleeding risk in patients receiving the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel.[@b6-vhrm-7-399],[@b7-vhrm-7-399] However, recent data suggest that PPI may lower the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation.[@b8-vhrm-7-399] Angiolillo et al suggested in their recent study that a metabolic drug--drug interaction exists between clopidogrel and omeprazole but not between clopidogrel and pantoprazole.[@b9-vhrm-7-399] This controversial drug interaction could be important among Chinese-American patients, who have an increased ulcer bleeding risk and"

Recently, repeated scanning within individuals has delineated the networks with high spatial precision ([@B8]; [@B37]; [@B55]; see also [@B31], [@B30]; [@B43]; [@B64]; [@B74]). Using such procedures, we discovered that the distributed transmodal network, often called the \"default network\" (DN; [@B4]; [@B12]; [@B82]), likely comprises at least two separate parallel networks ([@B8]). The two networks are closely juxtaposed throughout the cortex and interdigitated in a way that suggests why features of the more detailed organization are lost in group-averaged data. The two networks were referred to as *network A* and *network B*. One important distinction between the networks is that *network A* is coupled with the posterior parahippocampal cortex (PHC), whereas *network B* is not, suggesting that they may be functionally specialized.\n\nSince our observation of two separate networks, multiple studies of individuals have revealed related distinctions, but none with the same parallel structure distributed throughout the cortex (e.g., see the \"Default A\" and \"Default B\" networks in Fig. 4 of [@B51]; the \"Default\" network in Fig. 3 of [@B37]; see also [@B55]; [@B102])."
"INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nIron, used as a redox center by many enzymes, is an essential trace metal required by almost all living organisms. The intracellular level of free catalytically active iron is typically kept low due to its toxic effects. Free ferrous iron reacts with hydrogen peroxide, a natural by-product of aerobic respiration, to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH**^\u22c5^**) via the Fenton reaction ([@B1]). Due to this potentially damaging property of iron, there exists an intricate balance between iron transport, utilization, and storage. Most bacteria possess mechanisms to import iron in its oxidized ferric state (Fe^3+^), reduced ferrous state (Fe^2+^), or both (for reviews, see references [@B2] and [@B3]). The solubility of these two iron forms differs drastically at neutral pH: ferric iron has extremely low solubility at 10^\u221218^ M, whereas ferrous iron is readily soluble at 10^\u22121^ M. To take up ferric iron, bacteria have developed high-affinity ferric iron chelators called siderophores to capture, solubilize, and deliver insoluble iron into the cell ([@B4]). Unlike the Fe^3+^ transport system, which requires a number of proteins involved in siderophore synthesis and Fe^3+^ siderophore acquisition, the Fe^2+^ transport system appears to consist of mainly one protein, FeoB ([@B5]).

"Introduction\n============\n\nAccumulating evidence supports that various types of cancer are triggered by infection and chronic inflammatory disease ([@b1-mmr-13-02-1083]), and gastric cancer is a classical model of inflammation-associated cancer. Chronic inflammation actuates cellular events, which prompt malignant transformation of cells and even carcinogenesis ([@b2-mmr-13-02-1083]). Previous studies have confirmed that inflammatory cytokines are significant in the oncogenesis of gastric cancer ([@b3-mmr-13-02-1083],[@b4-mmr-13-02-1083]). In addition, a number of previous studies have suggested that polymorphisms in pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CC chemokine ligand (CCL)2, IL-8, CCL5 and PDGF, are associated with cancer ([@b5-mmr-13-02-1083]--[@b8-mmr-13-02-1083]).\n\nCCL2 is a member of the CC chemokine family, which predominantly binds with high affinity to the CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). CCL2 is a critical modulator of inflammation and is produced by a variety of cell types, including fibroblast cells, epithelial cells, mononuclear cells, astrocytes and certain tumor cells ([@b9-mmr-13-02-1083]). Previous studies have reported that CCL2 is widely detected in several types of cancer and is important in cancer progression. In prostate cancer, CCL2 mediates the interactions between normal and malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment and promotes prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis ([@b10-mmr-13-02-1083]).

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nChylous or lymphatic ascites is defined as the pathologic accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the peritoneal cavity \\[[@B1]\\]. More specifically, nonmalignant ascites is categorized into two types: chylous and lymphatic, depending on the the anatomic location of lymphatic injury \\[[@B1]\\]. Lymphatic ascites can result from congenital lymphatic abnormalities, nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis, and malignancy that occlude the lymphatic channels \\[[@B2]\\]. Postoperative lymphatic ascites is a rare complication, resulting from operative lymph node dissection or radiation \\[[@B2]\\].

Contrary to this, in continuum theories many open problems remain unsolved, typically in the field of viscous flow; since there are, in general, no obligatory construction rules for establishing variational principles, for certain problems a variety of suggestions have appeared from different authors based on different approaches.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nEndovascular therapy (EVT) has become the most effective treatment for patients with emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO).[@R1] The benefit of EVT, however, is highly time dependent, with each additional hour resulting in up to a 20% decreased chance of achieving a good outcome.[@R6] With only 10% of stroke centers capable of performing EVT, ELVO patients are often transferred from the primary hospital to an endovascular capable center after a delayed diagnosis, costing these patients an average of 110 additional minutes, increasing their chance of mortality, and substantially decreasing their chance of a good functional outcome.[@R7]\n\nIn 2017, the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) Mission: Lifeline Stroke Committee produced a severity based stroke triage algorithm for EMS.

"My colleague Vaskinn ([@B5]) published recently a commentary on my study on Emotion Perception in Norwegian Mensa (Egeland, [@B2]). My study is the first to actually test social cognition in Mensa Members, although self-ratings have been published previously (Karpinsky et al., [@B3]). Vaskinn questions the validity of the finding that Mensa members score superior to community controls on the EmoBio test of emotion recognition. When comparing the Mensa-study results to her own healthy controls in studies of patients with schizophrenia (Vaskinn et al., [@B7]) and bipolar disorder (Vaskinn et al., [@B6]) she points to a difference between the scores of her and my control groups. If the Mensa study had used her control group, the Mensa sample would not have performed better, in fact they performed numerically lower than her control group.\n\nHer point is important, and that is why all research has to be replicated with new community samples as well as new experimental groups. There are, however, two possible reasons for the difference in scores. The first is related to the distribution of age in her study compared to the Mensa study. The mean age was comparable (around 30 years) but the standard deviation in the Mensa study"

The half-life of tacrolimus in human is 8.7-11.3 h.\\[[@ref1]--[@ref3]\\] Absorption of tacrolimus has been shown to be highly variable between individuals. After oral administration, the drug is generally absorbed with mean time of peak concentrations of 1.5 to 2 hours.

"1. Introduction {#sec1-sensors-17-00251}\n===============\n\nOptical fiber sensors provide a number of advantages for sensing either temperature or strain in polymer matrix composites.

Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, in particular, can be used to accurately detect localized perturbations in strain and temperature with a high degree of spatial resolution due to their compact size \\[[@B4-sensors-17-00251],[@B5-sensors-17-00251]\\].

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nWhy is this field of research important? {#Sec2}\n----------------------------------------\n\nWith a rapidly rising global burden of disease attributed to non-communicable diseases, access to high quality primary health care (PHC) is essential. Complex interventions, defined as '*interventions that comprise multiple interacting components, although additional dimensions of complexity include the difficulty of their implementation and the number of organisational levels they target*', are frequently deployed in an attempt to address health system deficiencies experienced by patients and providers \\[[@CR1]\\]. Choosing a study design to assess effectiveness of complex interventions is not straightforward, and it is recommended to consider randomisation to prevent selection bias and provide robust evidence \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\]. Process evaluations, which are typically carried out in conjunction with randomised controlled trials of such interventions, can help explain for whom, how and why a complex intervention had a particular impact \\[[@CR4]\\].\n\nSuch evaluations address the question 'Is this intervention acceptable, effective, affordable and feasible (for me or) for this population?' \\[[@CR5]\\]. Process evaluations can enable patient-centred care by providing the opportunity for often over-looked patients' perspectives to be considered. As an example, while a pragmatic trial of a cardiovascular polypill in Australian PHC indicated the polypill was an effective,"

"Introduction {#s0005}\n============\n\nB-cell ligand recognition plays a large role in various immune responses ranging from the recognition of foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria to the recognition of cancerous cells. B-cells act as the body's most effective line of defense to invaders [@b0220]. Several types of responses may be induced in na\u00efve mature B-cells through the activation of different receptors (*e.g.*, cytokine and chemokine receptors) [@b0225], [@b0230]. Recognition of ligands by the B-cell Ag receptor (BCR) begins with the activation of an array of intracellular effector molecules and ends with phenotypic modifications that define the cell's response to the stimulus [@b0230]. As more and more players in this process are uncovered, the current schematic of BCR signal transduction has become a \"labyrinth\" of interconnecting pathways [@b0235]. Despite the complicated events that occur during this process, the resultant reaction is very ordered and precise. The activation of various signal transduction pathways in mature B cells is influenced by the combination of ligands presented to the B-cells. The presence of different ligands may trigger cell-proliferation, activation, differentiation, migration, isotype switching and apoptosis [@b0220], [@b0240], [@b0245]. Of particular interest in this area is the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms that are"
"Osteogenesis imperfecta (\"OI\" or \"Brittle bones\") is a rare genetic disorder of the connective tissue characterised by bone fragility. Other symptoms that may occur are: short stature, hearing impairment, skeletal deformities, loose joints or fragile teeth.\n\nAt present OI cannot be cured. Treatment is aimed at preventing or correcting its symptoms and at the best living conditions possible for OI-people. This usually involves orthopaedic surgery, steel rods, physiotherapy, possibly the prescription of certain drugs (bisphosphonates), sometimes hearing or dental treatment. Mutual support through the exchange of experience and information is of prime importance, both for those affected and for their families.

"INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nBrain tumor behavior is driven by aberrations in the genome and epigenome. Many, such as IDH mutations in diffuse low-grade glioma (DLGG) and aberrations in neurofibromatosis 2 (*NF2*) in hereditary and sporadic meningioma, are common among the same class of tumor ([@MCS004143WONC58]; [@MCS004143WONC11]; [@MCS004143WONC18]; [@MCS004143WONC7]; [@MCS004143WONC49]; [@MCS004143WONC69]). Knowledge of these aberrations has propelled the adoption of many into diagnostic neuropathology ([@MCS004143WONC49]). However, a given tumor may have other, less common genomic aberrations that are essential for its biological behavior, and knowledge of these may inform on the underlying biology, aberrant cellular pathways, and, most importantly, potential therapeutic agents ([@MCS004143WONC2]; [@MCS004143WONC20]; [@MCS004143WONC26]; [@MCS004143WONC66]).

"Introduction\n============\n\nThe field of microbiome research has seen rapid expansion this last decade ([@ref-21]). One of the techniques most frequently used to profile microbial communities is 16S rRNA gene sequencing, where PCR amplification of variable marker regions is used to determine a sample's microbial composition ([@ref-33]). The taxonomic resolution of sequence variation across a marker region is limited both biologically and technically, because sequence divergence may not represent wider biological divergence between taxa ([@ref-41]; [@ref-30]), and sequencing errors introduce artificial divergence ([@ref-18]; [@ref-37]). As a result, it is not necessarily useful to enumerate every unique sequence observed particularly given that samples may contain hundreds of thousands of unique reads. To simplify analyses, reads within a 16S rRNA gene dataset are typically collapsed into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). This is carried out based on sequence similarity between reads. Convention is typically to group reads that share at least 97% identity, which is considered \"species\" level. Although collapsing can be carried out to any threshold and there is no clear definition of what constitutes a bacterial species.\n\nA variety of methods are available to collapse 16S data to OTUs ([@ref-9]; [@ref-10]; [@ref-35]; [@ref-29]; [@ref-27]; [@ref-38]; [@ref-13]), often implemented within software wrappers"

It\\'s clinical manifestations include rhizomelic short stature, trident hand, genu varum, and elbow contractures. Spinal manifestations of achondroplasia include thoracolumbar kyphosis, foramen magnum stenosis, and spinal stenosis. Progressive kyphosis can result in spinal cord compression and paraplegia due to the reduced size of the achondroplastic spinal canal.

"Objective/purpose\n=================\n\nCD34 is a cell surface sialomucin that has been the subject of extensive interest, largely based on its use as a marker for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and vascular endothelia. Despite the almost ubiquitous use of CD34 as a HSC marker, little is known about its cellular function. Our lab was the first to show that CD34 is also highly expressed on mature murine mast cells, and we and other groups have found it to be expressed on eosinophils and dendritic cells. We found that mast cells derived from *Cd34^-/-^*mice exhibit a marked increase in cell-cell aggregation. Moreover, when *Cd34^-/-^*mice were challenged in a mouse model of asthma, immune cell accumulation in the lung was drastically reduced, while the number of immune cells in the lung at baseline was similar to that of their wild-type counterparts. We have since found that deletion of the *Cd34*gene in mice renders these animals resistant to a wide range of other mucosal inflammatory diseases, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), ulcerative colitis, salmonella infection and intestinal tumor development.

Reliable indexes for assessing the CHD risk and the extent of coronary stenosis are pivotal to manage and prevent this critical disease. The roles of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) in the development of CHD have been well established. Currently, increases in LDL-C, TC, TG and/or decreases in HDL-C are widely used to evaluate the risk of CHD in clinical practice. According to the 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines \\[[@CR3]\\] and the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) Guidelines \\[[@CR4]\\] of the United States, LDL-C is considered as the major cause of CHD and used as the primary target for therapy, and the other lipid parameters were used as the secondary or supplementary targets.\n\nAlthough there were growing arguments that the lipoprotein ratios, which have atherogenic components (TG, TC"
"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nBeta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), previously described as static encephalopathy of childhood with neurodegeneration in adulthood, is a genetic disease characterized by neurodegeneration with clear extrapyramidal symptoms, classified among neurodegenerative brain disorders with iron accumulation (NBIA). It is an X-linked disease (X p11.23) caused by *de novo* mutations in the WD repeat domain 45, a gene encoding a beta-propeller scaffold protein \\[hence the name BPAN ([@B1])\\] that is considered important for the phenomena of autophagy. Mutations described in literature are mostly *de novo* and most of the affected patients are female, probably because the mutation in homozygosity is not compatible with life, and the affected males would be characterized by somatic mosaicism ([@B2]).\n\nClinical and radiological features of BPAN were already a specific clinical entity before the discovery in 2013 of the responsible genetic mutation ([@B3]).\n\nThis disorder appears as a delay in the global maturity in childhood and it remains stable up to early adulthood. After a steady clinical situation during adolescence, the patient begins to develop serious parkinsonism together with signs of progressive cognitive impairment with a rapid onset ([@B4], [@B5]).\n\nOther clinical features that have been reported are history of epilepsy, spasticity, Rett-like syndrome features,"

"Background\n==========\n\nCerebral oximetry is a non-invasive monitoring method that can include the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology to provide an estimation of the regional cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rSO~2~). NIRS is simple to use and is not operator-dependent when compared with other brain monitoring devices, although an understanding of the technology behind the measurements is essential for clinicians to correctly interpret NIRS values. Extensive reviews of NIRS technology and the limitations of these devices in estimating cerebral oxygenation have previously been published \\[[@b1-amjcaserep-20-21]--[@b3-amjcaserep-20-21]\\].\n\nInfrared radiation (**IR**) is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) and has longer wavelengths than visible light (700--950 nm) and passes through tissue due to the relative transparency to light in this range of wavelengths. Once emitted, the light is absorbed by surrounding tissues according to their molecular properties, each having distinct absorption spectra in the NIRS. These absorbing molecules, called chromophores, include oxyhemoglobin (HbO~2~) and deoxyhemoglobin, with a maximal absorption spectrum between 700--850 nm \\[[@b4-amjcaserep-20-21]\\]. All NIRS-based monitoring techniques rely on a measure of optical attenuation, caused by light absorption and scattering. Using complex algorithms, NIRS monitors convert the measured changes of light attenuation into a numerical and trend display signal of rSO~2~.\n\nOne of the main"
"Overview of gene therapy\n========================\n\nThe ambitious objective of gene therapy is to edit a defective gene sequence *in situ* to achieve complete reversion of a disease phenotype for the lifetime of the patient. In spite of recent successes in site-specific correction of defective gene sequences, the focus of most gene therapy strategies to date is on gene addition rather than gene replacement ([@b67]). This simplified approach relies on a delivery mechanism to provide a corrected copy of the defective gene without removal of the error-containing genomic sequence.\n\nWhile literally hundreds of animal models of disease can now be effectively treated by gene transfer, a select few diseases remain the primary focus of much gene therapy research. A combination of factors including prevalence of disease, width of therapeutic window, ability to accommodate the corrected gene sequence in a gene transfer vector, reliability and availability of animal models of the disease, and funding and support from disease-specific foundations, all contribute to the overrepresentation of these few diseases.\n\nHaemophilia A and B are among the most extensively researched diseases in the field of gene therapy. Small and large animal models of both diseases are available for preclinical testing. Importantly, treatment of the"

The rules and duration of physical activities should be appropriate to the age of the participant and excessively long distance (competitive) running events are not recommended for children prior to maturation.\n\nImportant is the difference between competitive sport and not competitive, both in terms of efforts as hours per week as involvement in physical stress.\n\nSports activities are necessary also to prevent chronic diseases like obesity, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and anxiety.\n\nGood health or good physical condition is guaranteed by a healthy lifestyle rather than a genetic inheritance. Few but very important are the factors that contribute to a good aging, including physical movement."
"Introduction\n============\n\nPolyglandular autoimmune syndromes (PASs) are a heterogenous group of uncommon diseases defined by the presence of autoantibodies targeting two or more organ systems. Pernicious anemia (PA) was first described in the mid nineteenth century by Thomas Addison who recognized an association between adrenocortical failure and PA ([@bib1], [@bib2]). PASs were originally classified into two major types by Neufeld ([@bib3]) and later extended into three by Eisenbarth and Gottlieb ([@bib4], [@bib5]).\n\nPAS I, also called autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), involves the presence of two or more of the following three pathologies: chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism and Addison's disease, which tends to present in pediatric patients in the order listed. PAS II, also known as Schmidt's syndrome, is more common than PAS I and is defined by the presence of Addison's disease with either autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) or type 1 diabetes mellitus. PAS III, considered a subtype of PAS II, presents with AITD and one or more other organ-specific autoimmune disease(s), most commonly involving the pancreas, stomach, intestine or skin; the adrenal and parathyroid glands are uninvolved ([@bib5], [@bib6]).\n\nOne common association of AITD is pernicious anemia, defined as anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency resulting from"
"Background\n==========\n\nDry eye disease, or ocular surface disease (OSD), as defined by the International Dry Eye Workshop (2007),[@b1-opth-9-187] is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability, with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is associated with an increase in tear osmolarity and inflammation of the ocular surface.[@b1-opth-9-187] In clinical practice, an eye is considered to have OSD if there are symptoms of ocular discomfort such as gritty sensation, burning or transient blurring of vision, accompanied by objective evidence of dryness, as evidenced by a reduced tear breakup time (TBUT) or a lower Schirmer score without topical anesthesia.\n\nTrabeculectomy is the surgical treatment of choice to lower the intraocular pressure in eyes that are suboptimally controlled with topical antiglaucoma medications alone. Although the success rate of trabeculectomy has significantly improved with the standard use of mitomycin C (MMC) and other adjunctive antimetabolite treatment,[@b2-opth-9-187] complications such as OSD may compromise visual function postoperatively.

The elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in more than 50% of chronically infected patients by treatment with IFN-\u03b1 suggests that pDCs can play an important role in the control of HCV infection. pDCs exposed to HCV-infected hepatoma cells, in contrast to cell-free HCV virions, produce large amounts of IFN-\u03b1.\n\nMaterials and methods\n=====================\n\nTo further investigate the molecular mechanism of HCV sensing, we studied whether exposure of pDCs to HCV-infected hepatoma cells activates in parallel to interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-mediated production of IFN-\u03b1 also nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-dependent pDC responses such as expression of the differentiation markers CD40, CCR7, CD86, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin 6 (IL-6).\n\nRESULTS\n=======\n\nWe demonstrate that exposure of pDCs to HCV-infected hepatoma cells surprisingly did not induce phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB or cell surface expression of CD40, CCR7, CD86, and TRAIL, or secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6.

A family of recently demonstrated devices mimics the functions of neuromuscular and neurosensory systems---actuating, sensing, and signaling---by integrating hydrogels and elastomers. The hydrogels function as stretchable, transparent, ionic conductors. The elastomers function as stretchable, transparent dielectrics. The elastomers also function as seals to retard dehydration when the devices are in the open air, or to retard the exchange of solutes when the devices are in an aqueous environment.

"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nUnilateral spatial neglect frequently occurs after right hemisphere damage and is an invalidating multicomponent syndrome in which perception of the contralesional side of space is compromised \\[[@B1], [@B2]\\]. In line with the hemispheric rivalry theory \\[[@B3]\\], neglect patients bias their attention toward the right side of space \\[[@B4]\\], likely resulting from hemispheric imbalances in cortical excitability. Specifically, damage to the right hemisphere (RH) decreases activity in the contralesional cortex, which then leads to an increase in the excitability of the intact left hemisphere (LH) through the release of interhemispheric inhibition \\[[@B5], [@B6]\\]. Recent evidence suggests that the hyperexcitability of parietal-motor (PPC-M1) functional connections in the intact LH of patients with neglect can be reduced by applying inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Interestingly, these neurophysiological changes were associated with a decrease in the severity of neglect symptoms \\[[@B7], [@B8]\\].\n\nInhibitory rTMS applied to the RH of healthy individuals can induce neglect-like biases, such as a rightward shift in line bisection judgments \\[[@B9]--[@B11]\\].

This requires a tight coordination of microtubules and actin filaments in space and time [@R1]. It is ensured by common signaling pathways co-regulating the two network dynamics [@R2]. In addition, several cross-linkers support the physical interaction of microtubule plus ends with actin filaments at the cell periphery [@R3]--[@R5]. However, it is worth considering that such a crosstalk could also occur at the cell center, where microtubules minus-ends are connected to the centrosome.

Recent evidence suggests that these trends continue. Although limited in terms of the number of species tested, select wild mammal species produce viremias of titers at which they would be considered moderately competent hosts that likely have the capacity to infect mosquitoes \\[[@B2-viruses-11-00459]\\].

"Introduction\n============\n\nIt has been more than 40 years since the colonoscopic surveillance program for colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC) was introduced ([@bib1]). However, many uncertainties remain in managing this potentially challenging group of patients.\n\nFirst, the true magnitude of CRC risk and how this has changed over time needs to be confirmed. In our earlier study, we have showed that the incidence of CRC had significantly decreased over time between 1971 and 2000 ([@bib1]), and similar trends were observed in population-based studies from Denmark ([@bib2]) and Sweden ([@bib3]). However, it is unclear whether this trend has continued, as many aspects of surveillance programs have changed since our last study. For example, there has been an increase in use of advanced techniques, notably chromoendoscopy ([@bib4], [@bib5], [@bib6]), and some dysplastic lesions are now increasingly being managed endoscopically instead of by colectomy ([@bib7], [@bib8], [@bib9], [@bib10]).\n\nSecond, there are limited data on the risk of CRC occurring between scheduled surveillance procedures (or interval CRC). It is important to quantify these risks and assess how this has changed over time, as it may allow us to evaluate the efficacy of the colonoscopic surveillance program.\n\nThird, the prevalence"

Introduction {#sec1-materials-12-03878}\n===============\n\nThe presence of polyaromatic and cyclic compounds in diesel negatively affects the environment and reduces the quality of diesel, as well as lowers the cetane number, which is indicative of the ease of ignition thereof. Hydrotreatment is one of the most efficient methods for the removal of N and S from refinery currents, as well as for the saturation of alkenes and aromatics \\[[@B1-materials-12-03878],[@B2-materials-12-03878],[@B3-materials-12-03878],[@B4-materials-12-03878]\\]. It is important to highlight the multiplicity of reactions that come into play in hydrotreatment in this area of study. Taking into account the different elements that are considered contaminants in the refining processes of the petrochemical industry, within hydrotreatment we can distinguish hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), hydrodemetalization (HDM), and hydrodearomatization (HDA). The HDS has been extensively studied because sulfur is a pollutant that is present in higher proportions in crude oils of lower quality and also as an important catalyst deactivator because of poisoning \\[[@B5-materials-12-03878],[@B6-materials-12-03878],[@B7-materials-12-03878],[@B8-materials-12-03878],[@B9-materials-12-03878]\\]. However, removal of nitrogen from organic compounds present in various fractions of crudes is harder than sulfur removal, which leads to the importance of the study of the HDN reaction. In this process of heterogeneous catalysis, the industry currently uses variations of the following"
"INTRODUCTION {#sec1-1}\n============\n\nDislocation of lens nucleus or lens fragments into the vitreous cavity during phacoemulsification is an uncommon, but potentially sight threatening complication. It has been reported in up to 0.1% to 1.5% of cataract surgeries.\\[[@ref1][@ref2]\\] Retained fragments may result in severe intraocular inflammation, rise in intraocular pressure (IOP), and corneal edema. If not treated promptly, they may lead to cystoid macular edema (CME) and retinal detachment (RD).\n\nPars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with phacofragmentation is the preferred modality of treatment of dislocated lens fragments.\\[[@ref3][@ref4]\\] With availability of modern fragmatomes, the majority of cases can be managed successfully with satisfactory visual and anatomical results. However, the fragment tip with its axial movements tends to repel lenticular fragments during surgery, and the projectile nature of such a fragment may damage retina resulting in permanent visual loss. Perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCL) are an excellent adjunct to the surgery for prevention of this damage. But use of PFCLs raises the cost of surgery as well as total duration of surgery,\\[[@ref5]\\] and retained PFCL bubbles are associated with various complications.\n\nSince torsional phacoemulsification has lesser repulsive action on nuclear pieces, we conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of torsional hand piece in the management"
"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nPeptide binding to HLA (MHC) is the critical first step required for a T cell response. HLA binding enables antigen presenting cells to engage T cells via the T cell receptor to initiate a cascade of events that stimulate proinflammatory responses \\[[@B1], [@B2]\\]. Indeed, one of the most critical determinants of protein immunogenicity is the strength of peptide binding to MHC molecules \\[[@B3]\\]. Binding of antigenic peptides to HLA is desirable for vaccine design because immunogenic antigens produce protective T cell and antibody responses. However, the same interaction is often undesired in the context of biologic drug therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and replacement proteins, because neutralizing antibodies raised against the therapy lower drug efficacy. In several cases, immune responses to proteins administered as drugs or vaccines have been linked to a particular HLA allele, which is better able to bind peptides derived from the antigen \\[[@B4]--[@B6]\\]. Consequently, the ability to predict this relationship might be useful in clinical trial design; for example, subjects who carry specific HLA alleles could be excluded from a protein therapeutic trial. We set out to develop a statistical analysis tool, individualized T cell Epitope Measure (iTEM), which estimates the likelihood"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe early stages of a new, romantic relationship can be a powerful and absorbing experience. Individuals in new romantic relationships report feeling euphoric and energetic. They also become emotionally dependent on, desire closeness with, and have highly focused attention on their partner [@pone.0013309-Aron1]--[@pone.0013309-Reynaud1]. Human neuroimaging studies have shown that feelings experienced during the early stages of a romantic relationship are associated with neural activations in several reward-system and affect-processing regions of the brain [@pone.0013309-Aron1], [@pone.0013309-Bartels1], [@pone.0013309-Xu1]. Those studies displayed pictures of participants\\' own romantic partners [@pone.0013309-Mashek1] to reliably evoke acute positive affect and self-reported feelings of love. In one such functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, Aron and colleagues [@pone.0013309-Aron1] instructed participants in new, romantic relationships to view pictures of their partner, and pictures of a familiar acquaintance who was the same age and sex as the participant\\'s partner. Neural activations specific to viewing pictures of the romantic partner were observed in several reward-processing regions, such as the bilateral caudate nucleus and right ventral tegmental area.

All the patients were monitored with EKG, pulse oxymetry (Nellcor N200), invasive arterial pressure, pulmonary artery catheter when necessary and in-end expiratory gas analysis. Preoperatively an epidural catheter was inserted in T6-T11 space. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 0.5% vecuronium and fentanyl combined with epidural analgesia (bupivacaine 0.5% and fentanyl).

"Introduction {#sec1}\n============\n\nIt has been widely accepted that platelet aggregation and activation play an important role in the pathogenesis of thrombosis, including acute arterial thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, and coronary thrombosis, according to the pathophysiological mechanisms.^[@ref1]^ In the resting state, platelets are discoid and inactive. When vascular damage occurs, the locally exposed collagen and thrombin will activate platelets to produce ADP and thromboxane A2 (TXA~2~) to maintain continuous platelet activation. In general, the activation of platelets induced by agonists begins with the activation of the phospholipase C (PLC) isoforms expressed in platelets followed by the increase of Ca^2+^ concentration, causing the conformational change of the cell skeleton. Ultimately, subsequent intracellular signaling activates integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 on the platelet surface, thereby enabling platelet aggregation and adhesion. This process is mainly mediated by the interaction between the integrin receptor \u03b1IIb\u03b23 of activated platelets and fibrinogen, which leads to the formation of platelet-rich thrombus.^[@ref2]^\n\nAccordingly, the development of antiplatelet drugs that block platelet activation and aggregation will provide excellent therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent thrombotic diseases clinically. However, current antiplatelet drugs are still limited for their side effects, especially bleeding complications. Additionally, the latest study has shown that the use of low-dose"
"Background\n==========\n\nIn primary gynecological malignancies, vulvar carcinoma is relatively rare, constituting approximately 3% to 5%. One of the most common types of vulvar carcinoma is squamous cell carcinoma, which accounts for about 90% of malignant tumors, whereas melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, Pap adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, and Paget's disease are much less common \\[[@B1]\\]. Early vulvar squamous cell carcinoma has not been taken seriously enough for lack of obvious symptoms.\n\nOf the 150 patients with confirmed vulvar squamous cell carcinoma who were treated in our cancer center, 35 cases (23%) were early carcinoma (stage I). In recent years, many scholars have advocated for implementing individualized surgical treatment with different operations according to the position, depth of invasion and other risk factors in early vulvar squamous cell carcinoma cases. But identification of early incidence is relatively low, fewer cases are reported, and operation mode and prognostic factors still incite controversy. This paper sums up the clinical data of early vulvar squamous cell carcinoma for 20 years with the objective of evaluating the impact of clinicopathologic prognostic factors and different surgical methods on early-stage vulvar squamous cell carcinoma prognosis.\n\nMethods\n=======\n\nFrom January 1980 to December 2005, 35 patients with early-stage invasive squamous"
"Introduction\n============\n\nThe ability of elasmobranch fishes to retain very high concentrations of the nitrogenous waste urea in their body fluids for the purpose of osmoregulation has fascinated biologists for more than a century ([@ref-19]; [@ref-20]; [@ref-21]). Of particular interest is the ability of the gills to maintain extremely low effective permeability to urea while allowing for O~2~ and CO~2~ exchange at comparable rates to teleost fishes. For example, [@ref-13] have made the instructive calculation that given the high blood plasma concentrations of urea (typically 300--400\u00a0mmol\u00a0L^\u22121^) in elasmobranchs, if their gill urea permeability was comparable to that of teleosts, urea efflux would be about 10,000\u00a0\u00b5mol kg^\u22121^ h^\u22121^, about 40 fold higher than typical values measured *in vivo* ([@ref-22]).\n\nThere have been only a few studies on the mechanism of urea retention at the gills, all of them on the spiny dogfish *Squalus acanthias*. [@ref-2] concluded that the lipid membranes in the gills were of unusual composition, resulting in exceptionally low permeability to urea, a conclusion based largely on changes in urea efflux rate with temperature. However he did raise (and dismiss) the possibility of a retention mechanism based on active transport.\n\nNevertheless, the latter idea gained some"

The circulation of these pathogens within insect vectors involves several steps: (i) entry into and multiplication in gut epithelial cells of the alimentary canal, (ii) entry into the hemocoel and circulation in hemolymph, and (iii) final entry into and multiplication in salivary glands, which results in successful pathogen transmission to new plants *via* insect saliva^[@CR2]--[@CR4]^. Previous studies of plant viruses and plant pathogenic bacteria have shown that the alimentary canal and salivary glands are the major organs that determine vector competence^[@CR3]--[@CR5]^.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nDespite the tremendous progress made in intensive neuroprotective therapy and invasive surgical strategies, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains a devastating disorder with a high risk of mortality and severe disability (Laiwalla et al., [@B21]; van Gijn et al., [@B32]). Early brain injury (EBI) occurs in the first 72 h following SAH, contributing to a poor prognosis (Cahill et al., [@B1]; Guo et al., [@B18]). Compelling evidence has indicated that an intrinsic apoptotic or autophagic cell death pathway is involved in EBI (Jing et al., [@B20]; Chen et al., [@B6]). Although an appealing hypothesis has been proposed that apoptosis and autophagy may be regulated by a common cellular factor (Dhingra and Kirshenbaum, [@B10]), no study has explored this missing link between apoptosis and autophagy in EBI after SAH.\n\nMelatonin is an evolutionarily conserved neuro-hormone that is predominantly synthesized in and secreted from the pineal gland (Hu et al., [@B19]). Experimental evidence has demonstrated that both melatonin and its metabolites are potent free-radical scavengers and broad-spectrum antioxidants (Zhang et al., [@B39]), which maintain cellular homeostasis and survival by modulating inflammation, apoptosis, or autophagy following different types of brain injury (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., [@B15]).

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nAcute abdominal pain is a common chief complaint in clinical practice, particularly in the emergency department (ED) ([@B1]). In the ED, prompt differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain is essential, since delayed or missed diagnoses are associated with high morbidity and mortality ([@B1]-[@B4]). In order to obtain an accurate diagnosis, abdominal computed tomography (CT) has been widely used as a diagnostic tool ([@B1]-[@B4]). Therefore, the ability offer accurate preliminary interpretations of CT images is required for an emergency resident ([@B5]).\n\nThe ability of radiology residents to interpret radiologic images, including CT images, has been well established in previous studies ([@B6]-[@B15]).

Generally, prospective randomized trials of BCG have been used to evaluate efficacy of BCG, and retrospective case-control studies of BCG have been used to compare effectiveness of different BCG vaccine strains. Although measures of BCG prevention effectiveness/efficacy have not been consistent [@pone.0032567-Comstock1], when BCG immunization of newborns was stopped in Sweden, a circumstance that provided a non-vaccinated comparison group, a six-fold increase in TB notifications was observed in infants [@pone.0032567-Romanus1]. In a prospective randomized control trial in Britain in which over 50,000 older children were allocated to no vaccination or one of two vaccine groups, comparable prevention efficacy of 81% to 84% was found among those vaccinated with BCG (*Mycobacterium bovis*) or with vole bacillus (*Mycobacterium microti*), respectively, when data were compared over a 20-year period [@pone.0032567-Hart1].

"Background\n==========\n\n\\\"Seamless care\\\" is the continuity of care delivered to a patient in the health care system across the spectrum of caregivers and health care settings \\[[@B1]\\]. This delivery of care should be consistent with the ongoing needs of the individual patient. In practice, several breaks or practice gaps can occur in the continuity of patient care.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nGround-glass nodule (GGN) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is defined as lesions showing hazy, increased attenuation that does not obscure underlying bronchial structures or pulmonary vessels ([@B1]--[@B3]). Early-stage lung adenocarcinoma nodules often manifest GGN associated with a pathological, lepidic growth pattern ([@B4]). According to the pathology classification in 2011, lung adenocarcinoma has been divided into pre-invasive lesions including atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and adenocarcinoma *in situ* (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IA) ([@B5]--[@B7]). The suggested therapeutic strategy for each differs according to different subgroups of adenocarcinoma classification. Compared with IA, AIS, and MIA can be treated with wedge or segmental resection with a 100% or near 100% of 5-year survival rate ([@B8]). Therefore, preoperative, non-invasive radiological assessment of the invasiveness of lung adenocarcinoma is essential.\n\nHistology is currently the gold standard to assess the invasiveness of lung adenocarcinoma. However, it is generally difficult to assess the overall invasiveness of GGNs before surgery. Traditional evaluation using CT can determine values such as tumor size, CT attenuation value, and the percentage of the solid component in GGN, which can help differentiate the invasiveness of the adenocarcinoma ([@B4], [@B6], [@B7]).

"Background\n==========\n\nPIN1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein, belonging to the evolutionarily conserved peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) family. PIN1 isomerizes p(Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs in the target proteins, which leads to the alteration of their structure, function, intracellular localization and/or stability \\[[@B1]\\]. Previous studies have demonstrated that PIN1 plays a crucial role in multiple cellular processes and, likewise, it has been implicated in pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer, inflammation to neurodegenerative diseases \\[[@B2]-[@B8]\\].\n\nThe gene encoding PIN1 maps to chromosome 19p13.2, a region associated with late-onset Alzheimer\\'s disease (LOAD) \\[[@B9]\\]. Moreover, *PIN1*is the only known gene whose knockout in mice can cause both Tau and A\u03b2-related pathologies in an age-dependent manner \\[[@B4],[@B10]\\]. It was shown that PIN1-catalysed conformation change of pT668 could prevent amyloidogenic processing of APP \\[[@B10]\\]. Additionally, in a similar manner PIN1 may indirectly reverse the hyperphosphorylation of Tau, restoring its ability to bind microtubules, as well as inhibit GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation \\[[@B5],[@B11]\\]. As overexpression of PIN1 in vitro induced a reduction in amyloidogenic processing of APP, it has been proposed that functional PIN1 could prevent or slow down AD onset \\[[@B10]\\]. On the other hand, PIN1 dysfunction or down-regulation e.g. under the oxidative stress, would favor *cis*form of pT668 APP"
"INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that is characterized by social, communicative and cognitive deficits and has a higher prevalence in males ([@BIO041327C16]). The incidence of autism is considered high in the population all over the world: about 1 in 59 children have been identified with ASD ([@BIO041327C5]). Although it is considered that the etiology of autism is unknown, genetic and environmental factors (such as prenatal infections and maternal dietary disturbs) have been described as autistic triggers ([@BIO041327C25]; [@BIO041327C26]; [@BIO041327C55]).\n\nWe have shown that exposure of rats to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, gram-negative bacteria endotoxin) during gestation \\[gestational day (GD) 9.5\\] induces socialization and communication deficits as well as repetitive/restricted behavior in juvenile offspring. These behavioral impairments are found just in males and not in the female offspring ([@BIO041327C31], [@BIO041327C33]; [@BIO041327C30]). Therefore, our model of exposure of rats to LPS during gestation induces autistic-like behaviors in juvenile offspring ([@BIO041327C33]).

The first steps in detecting and discriminating environmental chemicals are performed by chemoreceptor cells, which possess the receptor proteins that bind the chemicals. Characterizing these receptor proteins is fundamental to understanding chemosensory transduction and, more broadly, mechanisms of chemical sensing.\n\nAlthough crustaceans are one of the largest and most diverse animal taxa with nearly 70,000 extant species living in diverse environments \\[[@pone.0203935.ref001], [@pone.0203935.ref002]\\], relatively little is known about their chemoreceptor proteins. Given that crustaceans are well-established models of chemoreception \\[[@pone.0203935.ref003]--[@pone.0203935.ref006]\\], the lack of data on their receptor proteins has limited our understanding of the organization of their chemical senses at the cellular and molecular levels.

"One of the most important goals of material science in contemporary photonics is developing materials with manageable light-matter interaction. The self-assembly of wavelength-scale colloidal building blocks is an attractive approach for the design of such photonic materials since they enable engineering of photonic properties in an experimentally simple and large-area approach[@b1][@b2]. The application area of such materials spans from photovoltaic devices[@b3] and lasers[@b4] to sensors[@b5] and structural coloration[@b6].\n\nConceptually, nanostructured photonic materials can be divided into either ordered or amorphous materials[@b7][@b8]. Ordered colloidal photonic crystals are characterized by long-range order of the individual scattering elements[@b1] resulting in a periodic lattice.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nQuinoa (*Chenopodium quinoa* Willd., Amaranthaceae) is an Andean seed-producing crop cultivated since ca. 7000 years around Lake Titicaca in the Andean highlands (*altiplano*) from where it spread as far north as Ecuador and down to southern Chile, and from 3800 m above sea level to coastal and lowlands areas. This diversification in terms of native habitats and the wide genetic diversity has led to the identification of five ecotypes: *salares* (salt flats), highlands, inter-Andean valleys, *yungas*, and coastal-lowlands. The *salares* of the Andes are found principally in southern Bolivia, northern Chile, and Argentina. These highland deserts are extremely arid; temperatures often fall well below freezing and quinoa is the only crop that can grow under these edapho-climatic conditions (Fuentes et al., [@B26]). Other landraces (local varieties) are adapted to totally different environments. For example, in central and southern Chile, quinoa can grow at sea level; here annual rainfall, distributed throughout the year, ranges from 400 to 1500--2000 mm and soils have a high water retention capacity. Thus, quinoa has attracted the attention of scientists since over a decade mainly for its extreme tolerance and adaptability to unfavorable environmental conditions, such as salinity, drought, and frost (Jacobsen et"

"Introduction\n============\n\nUnbalanced rearrangements leading to chromosomal and thereby genomic imbalance have been traditionally associated with abnormal phenotypes. While rearrangements involving sex chromosomes may not be linked to severe motor impairment, those involving autosomes may result in dysmorphic facies, malformations and mental retardation (MR). Further, the detection of chromosome ends in majority of the translocations has emphasized the role of telomeric rearrangements as the cause of several genetic diseases. The telomeric regions of human chromosomes are enriched for CpG islands and have been reported to have the highest gene density in the entire genome \\[[@B1]\\].\n\nTelomeres composed of the hexameric TG-rich repeat (TTAGGG)n sequences and ranging from 2 to 15 kb in length, cap the ends of mammalian chromosomes. They are very essential for the stability and integrity of the chromosomes by preventing end to end fusion and exonucleolytic degradation.

Compared to the widely studied embryonic or bone marrow-derived MSCs, PMSCs have several advantages, including no ethical issues as the placenta is a medical waste generally discarded after birth, large availability, and no invasive injury for the donor^[@CR2]^. Therefore, PMSCs are an excellent cell source for regenerative medicine. Although most of the mesenchymal stem cells isolated from different sources are very similar in an undifferentiated state, differences in capacity for multilineage cell differentiation have also been observed.

The disease has an annual incidence of 2.7 cases per 100,000 people in Europe \\[[@B1]\\] and most patients succumb to the disease within 3 to 5 years after onset. On average 10% of all ALS cases are familial, of which 20% are caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe directional transfer of membrane and soluble proteins from one cellular compartment to another is essential for cell survival. A critical step in these membrane trafficking events is the selective fusion of vesicles with target organelles. SNAREs (Soluble *N*-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptors) are key components of the machinery required to maintain selectivity, and are directly responsible for fusion. These small proteins localize to organelle and vesicle membranes and interact when the two membranes are in close proximity. The energy released from their interaction is thought to drive fusion [@pone.0086425-Jahn1].\n\nOne R-SNARE on the vesicle membrane and three Q-SNAREs on the target membrane interact to form a helical bundle. In general, four distinct SNAREs participate in the helical bundle, although there are some Q-SNAREs (members of the SNAP25 subfamily) that contribute two helices to the coil [@pone.0086425-Holt1]. Unlike most SNAREs, which are transmembrane proteins, these Q-SNAREs that contain two SNARE motifs are palmitoylated [@pone.0086425-Jahn1].

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nThe *systems* perspective to biology has successfully rephrased long-standing questions in developmental biology in terms of the dynamical behavior of molecular networks \\[[@CR1]-[@CR4]\\]. A salient example is the increasing use of gene regulatory network (GRN) models to study cell-fate specification \\[[@CR5]-[@CR9]\\]. How can cells with the same genotype and gene regulatory network in multicellular organisms attain different cell fates? How are the steady-state gene expression configurations that characterize each cell-type attained? Why do we observe certain cellular phenotypes and not others? How are the temporal and spatial patterns of cell-fate decisions established and how are they robustly maintained? The dynamical analysis of GRNs has given insights into these and other important questions concerning cell differentiation and morphogenesis, the two components of development. In short, GRN models are showing how observed differentiation patterns can be understood in mechanistic terms \\[[@CR10]\\]. Overall, experimentally grounded GRN models constitute multistable dynamical systems able to recover stable steady states (or *attractors*) corresponding to fixed profiles of gene activation that mimic those characterizing different cell types in both plants and animals (e.g., \\[[@CR11],[@CR12]\\]). Such profiles are commonly interpreted as cell fates \\[[@CR1],[@CR4],[@CR13]\\].\n\nThe first, and arguably the simplest, model of GRN dynamics is"

TCR\u03b2 chain rearranges first in CD4^\u2212^ CD8^\u2212^ double negative (DN) cells and is expressed on the cell surface with a pre-T\u03b1 chain and the components of CD3 complex. Thymocytes that express a pre-T\u03b1/TCR\u03b2 chain complex transition to the immature CD4^+^ CD8^+^ double positive (DP) stage and initiate the rearrangement of the TCR\u03b1 chains. TCR\u03b1 chain rearrangement persists until a productive interaction between the TCR\u03b1\u03b2 complex and the MHC complex is registered by the positive selection of the T cell. If the cell fails to be positively selected, a secondary V\u03b1-J\u03b1 rearrangement proceeds to replace the failed TCR\u03b1 chain [@pone.0115803-Goldrath1]. This temporal process is initiated at the 5\u2032 end of the J\u03b1 cluster and progresses through the 3\u2032 J\u03b1s during the lifetime of the DP thymocyte [@pone.0115803-Guo1].

Hypothalamus--pituitary--adrenocortical (HPA) axis reactivity to stress, one of the most common analysis in this field, has also been found to have a similar effect on cardiovascular health \\[[@CR4]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nIn the vertebrate nervous system, long axons have emerged as the \\'bottle neck\\' of neuronal integrity ([@bib9]; [@bib21]; [@bib14]). In neurodegenerative diseases, axons often reveal first signs of perturbation, e.g. spheroids, long before the pathological hallmarks of disease are seen in neuronal somata, such as large protein aggregates or neuronal cell death. In white matter tracts, Wallerian degeneration of axons is a carefully regulated program of self-destruction that upon reaching a threshold leads to rapid calcium-dependent proteolysis of axonal proteins. This degeneration can be experimentally triggered in different ways, including acute axonal dissection or by blocking mitochondrial energy metabolism ([@bib9]; [@bib14]). In disease situations, the mechanisms leading to axon loss are much less clear. For example, in spastic paraplegia (SPG), which comprises an entire family of inherited axon degeneration disorders, long myelinated tracts of the spinal cord are progressively lost. However, virtually none of the subforms shows a clear link between the primary defect and the later loss of myelinated axons, with the possible exception of mitochondrial disorders, in which the perturbation of axonal energy metabolism is assumed to underlie a loss of axonal ATP ([@bib11]; [@bib30]). However, a disturbed energy balance has never been shown. Similarly,"

Its worldwide production is approximately 671 million tons per annum in 215 million Ha areas (Baloglu et al., [@B5]; Inal et al., [@B26]; Okay et al., [@B38]). Wheat faces intensive biotic and abiotic stresses during its growth period. It was estimated that 10--16% of yield losses in wheat were due to pathogens (Oerke, [@B37]). *Fusarium* head blight (FHB) causes severe damages on wheat and other small grain cereals (Zhu et al., [@B62]). Although several fungal species of the *Fusarium* genus can cause FHB, the ascomycete fungus *F. graminearum* (telomorph: *Gibberella zeae*) is a major causal agent for FHB (Jung et al., [@B29]). Fg parasitizes roots, stems, leaves, and reproductive tissues of many species of cereals and grasses. FHB potentially causes dramatic economic losses in wheat, barley and other grasses (Bischof et al., [@B10]; Montibus et al., [@B36]).

"The concept that the central nervous system (CNS) is an immunologically privileged organ has had a profound impact on the study of immune-to-brain interactions. Even though it is now well recognized that this immune privilege is only partial \\[[@CR1]\\], for many neuroscientists, the nervous system is still perceived to be isolated from the immune system, with its components playing little or no role in the neural networks and communicating pathways. It is also the case that for many immunologists, the CNS is a foreign land. It is clear that the interaction between the nervous and immune systems is a two-way communication, each having a profound influence on the other. These influences extend from homeostasis to pathology, with the immune system acting as a major transducer of both internal and external environmental challenges to the host. Involvement of the immune system can arise from CNS resident innate immune cells or from cellular and soluble factors from the periphery that act on the CNS via neural or humoural routes.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nAnnotation of the human and mouse genomes has identified more than 20,000 protein-coding genes and more than 3,000 noncoding RNA genes. Together, these genes orchestrate the development and function of the organism from fertilization through embryogenesis to adult life. Despite the dramatic increase in knowledge of variation in human genomes of healthy and diseased individuals, the normal functions of common forms of most genes are still unknown and consequently the disease significance of rare variants remains obscure as well.\n\nTo determine gene function, mutation of those genes is required in model organisms. The mouse has long been regarded as ideal for this purpose. Conservation of most aspects of mammalian development, anatomy, metabolism, and physiology between humans and mice is underscored by strong one-to-one orthologous relationships between genes of the two species. Conservation of gene function is strongly supported by similar phenotypic consequences of complete or partial loss-of-function mutations in orthologous genes in both species and by functional replaceability of mouse genes by their human counterparts (Wallace et al.

"Introduction\n============\n\nCalorie restriction (CR), a dietary regimen in which subjects (typically test animals) receive a reduced energy diet (typically, a 20 to 40% reduction in total energy intake relative to an unrestricted comparison group), is one of the most potent and broadly acting dietary interventions for preventing or reversing weight gain and inhibiting cancer in experimental tumor models \\[[@B1]\\]. Recent reports of decreased risk of diabetes, neurological degeneration, and cancer in response to CR in rhesus monkeys \\[[@B2],[@B3]\\], and observations that CR decreases inflammatory and endocrine markers associated with increased breast cancer risk in women \\[[@B4],[@B5]\\], suggest that the beneficial effects of CR on metabolism and chronic disease risk observed in rodent models may extend to human beings.\n\nObservational epidemiologic studies provide additional evidence that CR exerts beneficial effects on longevity and cancer risk in human beings \\[[@B1]\\]. For example, inhabitants of Okinawa, Japan, who until recently had consumed significantly fewer calories than residents of the main Japanese islands, have always had lower death rates from cancer and other chronic diseases than inhabitants of the Japanese mainland \\[[@B6]\\]. In addition, patients with early-onset anorexia nervosa, and hence periods of energy restriction, have reduced risk of breast cancer \\[[@B7]\\]. Furthermore,"
"1. Introduction {#sec1-sensors-19-01742}\n===============\n\nEstablishing an accurate and clear indoor map is a basic requirement of Indoor Navigation and Location-Based Services (INLBS). Mobile mapping is a highly efficient method for constructing an indoor map. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a popular and applicable method for mobile mapping in a GNSS-denied area, especially indoor environments \\[[@B1-sensors-19-01742],[@B2-sensors-19-01742]\\].\n\nSLAM estimates the pose and map in an unknown environment simultaneously \\[[@B3-sensors-19-01742]\\]. According to the type of sensors, the SLAM techniques can be classified into vision-based and range-based approaches. Vision-based SLAM uses monocular, stereo or RGBD cameras to accomplish navigation and mapping and can obtain rich texture information \\[[@B4-sensors-19-01742],[@B5-sensors-19-01742],[@B6-sensors-19-01742],[@B7-sensors-19-01742],[@B8-sensors-19-01742]\\]. While it is the cheapest approach, there are some disadvantages that limit its applications in indoor mapping, such as its sensitivity to lighting conditions, computational cost for processing large amounts of image data and the necessity for accurate calibration \\[[@B9-sensors-19-01742]\\]. Range-based SLAM using sonar or laser sensors are applied in most indoor mapping techniques \\[[@B9-sensors-19-01742],[@B10-sensors-19-01742],[@B11-sensors-19-01742],[@B12-sensors-19-01742]\\], because of its advantages of low complexity of data acquired and insensitivity to lighting conditions \\[[@B9-sensors-19-01742]\\]. In this paper, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is utilized, which is one of the most popular ranging sensors, with a high ranging accuracy"
"Introduction\n============\n\nSystemic lupus eythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune pathology which due to the diversity of its clinical and immunological manifestations represents the prototype of autoimmune connective tissue diseases. It can virtually involve any self structure of the body and exhibits a large spectrum of clinical manifestations including cutaneous and joint disease, renal disease, haematological involvement and central nervous system disease ([@B1], [@B2], [@B3]).\n\nRenal disease represents a frequent manifestation of SLE as well as an important outcome predictor in these patients. Although pathologically, the majority of patients with SLE may present a degree of renal involvement (glomerulopathy), a clinically relevant kidney disease occurs in about 50% of patients, mostly the consequence of the deposition or in situ formation of immune complexes containing anti-DNA in the kidney. As expected, the mortality has higher rates in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) than in those without renal disease, and some of these (10-60%) can develop end-stage renal failure that requires the substitution of the renal function.\n\nThe appropriate use of corticosteroids and newer immunosuppressive agents with a judicious application of the current guidelines in patients with LN had a pivotal role in increasing the survival rate of these patients for up to"
"Renal Anemia {#s1}\n============\n\nCurrently, over 10% of the population worldwide suffers from chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is characterized by kidney dysfunction and/or proteinuria that persists for more than 3 months ([@B33]). A gradual decline in kidney function results in sclerotic lesions, cardiovascular disease, and mortality ([@B23]; [@B18]). While the etiologies of CKD are diverse, ranging from lifestyle-related diseases to autoimmune disorders, CKD progression is commonly accompanied by kidney fibrosis, in which myofibroblasts emerge and proliferate in the renal tubular interstitium ([@B43]). Because kidneys are the major organs producing erythroid growth factor erythropoietin (EPO) in adult mammals ([@B55]; [@B19]), erythropoiesis is often impaired in CKD patients ([@B37]). The liver supportively produces EPO under anemic conditions, but hepatic EPO production cannot adequately compensate for renal EPO production in renal anemia patients. In fact, mice lacking renal *EPO* gene expression exhibit severe anemia, although *EPO*-gene expression is induced in their hepatocytes ([@B69]; [@B20]).\n\nBecause EPO is required for erythropoiesis, gene-modified mouse lines lacking EPO production exhibit embryonic lethality due to severe anemia ([@B67]; [@B69]). Since red blood cells are essential for oxygen delivery to every organ, renal anemia severely decreases the quality of life (QOL) of CKD patients. To maintain oxygen"
"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nIt is well documented that patients who are immunocompromised are susceptible to a multitude of opportunistic organisms. Two of the more well-documented organisms that are clinically seen are *Aspergillus* and *Cryptococcus* species \\[[@B1]\\]. Both of these species individually have the capability of causing a primary infection of a single organ (typically lung) or rarely a disseminated infection causing multiorgan dysfunction \\[[@B2], [@B3]\\]. Concurrent infections among these two fungal species are even more uncommon. Current published literature comprises of only a very limited amount of case reports which describe cases in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts \\[[@B4]--[@B6]\\]. Pending patient\\'s clinical course, optimal therapy for these two species includes the triazoles \\[[@B7]--[@B10]\\].

Among them, 28 million people are eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, only 11.7 million could afford antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. In spite of significant advances in highly active ART, the elimination of HIV-1 reservoirs from the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system (CNS) remains an ultimate challenge.[@b4-ijn-11-4317] This is attributed to the integration of HIV-1 genome with host genome, thereby causing viral latency in the periphery and in brain, as well. Furthermore, the inability of ART to penetrate the blood--brain barrier (BBB) after systemic administration makes brain as one of the most dominant HIV infection reservoirs.[@b1-ijn-11-4317] Developing the best suitable therapeutics for HIV demands multidisciplinary research and development approaches involving smart sensors, novel imaging agents, smart portable diagnostic tools, biomarkers, novel bioimaging, efficient affinity agents, smart assaying, real-time disease monitoring, and disease management systems to develop accessible cost-effective diagnosis and treatment for HIV patients.[@b1-ijn-11-4317]\n\nAdvancements in analysis have proven a significant role in HIV diagnostics and monitoring of disease progression.

"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nResearch shows that depression is relatively rare in children but becomes more prevalent in adolescence. At the same time, the sex ratio also changes considerably; whereas there is little evidence of gender differences in children, depression during adolescence is significantly more common among girls than boys \\[[@B1], [@B2]\\]. Another problem behavior that develops approximately at the same time is deliberate self-harm (henceforth referred to as self-harm), here defined as self-inflicted damage to the surface of one\\'s own body. (It should be noted that the definition used in this study does not include behaviors like taking an overdose or self-poisoning. In this way, it is similar to the proposed diagnosis of \"nonsuicidal self-injury\" in the DSM-V \\[[@B19]\\], although our definition differs from this notion by not explicitly excluding suicidal intentions.). The mean age of onset of this kind of self-harm is reported to be around 12--15\u2009years \\[[@B3], [@B4]\\], and self-harm is quite frequently reported among young adolescents \\[[@B5]--[@B11]\\].

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF) is meant to help low income caregivers gain employment skills, secure employment and reach self-sufficiency. However, after 20 years of research on the impacts of TANF, it is clear that it falls short of helping people enter the workforce and stay there, and that TANF participants have serious behavioral health challenges that affect their ability to reach self-sufficiency (Bryner and Martin [@CR10]; Dworsky and Courtney [@CR26]; Martin and Caminada [@CR56]). In order to receive TANF, caregivers with young children under age six are required to participate in 20 \"work hours\" per week that may include job search, training, or other programming. However, evidence shows that the majority of such programs do not address the well-being of families, nor are there incentives to help caregivers find steady well-paying opportunities (Corcoran et al. [@CR19]; Danziger [@CR23]; Hildebrandt and Stevens [@CR43]; Kaplan et al. [@CR45]). In many instances, TANF participants may get jobs, but do not succeed in keeping them, only to return to TANF again (Hildebrandt and Kelber [@CR42]; Hildebrandt and Stevens [@CR43]; Ziliak [@CR77]).\n\nAlmost one third of TANF recipients have a work-limiting health condition, and high rates of exposure"

He reported that ulcers began after the Chilean earthquake in 2010. His medical history was not significant. Ulcerations showed remissions and exacerbations since earthquake. On clinical examination, skin and other sites involvement was not found. An incisional biopsy was taken from the cheek region. Histopathological examination revealed suprabasilar blister formation associated with acantholysis (D and E). Hence, a final diagnosis of oral pemphigus vulgaris (OPV) was made based on histopathological pattern and clinical features. Treatment regimen included oral prophylaxis; prednisone and betamethasone 3-4 times daily for topical application. The patient was controlled every 2 weeks for the first 1 month. The lesions had diminished and increased healing with steroids within 4 weeks of starting the treatment. The patient was kept under observation for 12 months and the lesions showed signs of recurrence.

In western Europe, the incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea declined from 1980 to 1991 to less than 2% per 100,000 persons for syphilis and less than 20% per 100,000 persons for gonorrhea. However, in Ukraine, since 1989, the notification rate of syphilis has skyrocketed---from 5 per 100,000 persons in 1990 to 170 in 1995. In some regions, this rate exceeds 220 cases per 100,000 persons. Moreover, cases among children younger than 14 years of age are also increasing. In 1995, the syphilis rate for persons older than 30 years of age was 170 per 100,000; 600 per 100,000 girls younger than 15 years of age; and 1,550 to 2,000 per 100,000 girls 15 to 16 years of age.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe human Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) is expressed and secreted by neurones innervating primary and secondary immune organs, and is involved in smooth muscle relaxation, exocrine and endocrine secretion, and water and ion flux in lung and intestinal epithelia [@pone.0012067-Barbezat1]--[@pone.0012067-Lelievre1]. VIP has also a strong anti-inflammatory effects in several models of chronic and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [@pone.0012067-Paladini1]--[@pone.0012067-GonzalesRey2]. VIP signals through three type II, G-coupled receptors, PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2, triggering a cascade of intracellular events that differ depending on cell and receptor types [@pone.0012067-Laburthe1]. VPAC1 is ubiquitous and highly conserved through species [@pone.0012067-Sreedharan1]. The down-modulation of the VPAC1 has been described in response to activating stimuli in cells of the immune system [@pone.0012067-LaraMarquez1]. This has been interpreted as a transient switching off of the regulatory pathway mediated by VIP that counterbalances the inflammatory signals. Indeed VIP can modulate the production of some inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and therefore acts as an important player in orchestrating the inflammatory response [@pone.0012067-Toumi1], [@pone.0012067-Kojima1]. Furthermore, VIP has been shown to induce human tolerogenic DCs that, in turn, promote regulatory T cells [@pone.0012067-GonzalezRey1], [@pone.0012067-Pozo1]. Therefore, VIP signalling might play a role in dysregulating the immune system leading to autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, a"

"Findings {#Sec1}\n========\n\nIt is commonplace for a single receptor to recognize a number of different ligands and a single ligand to bind to a number of different receptors \\[[@CR1]\\]. In many cases, the distinct biological output elicited by each ligand is due to its interaction with a different epitope on the surface of a receptor, triggering a defined signaling pathway. In some unique cases, a receptor is able to interact with different ligands using an identical set of amino acids, yet each ligand results in a distinct biological outcome.\n\nA prominent example of this type of promiscuity is the prolactin receptor (PRL-R), which uses the same set of amino acids on its extracellular domain (ECD) to bind to two different hormones: prolactin (PRL) \\[[@CR2],[@CR3]\\] and growth hormone (GH) \\[[@CR4],[@CR5]\\]. Prolactin receptor signaling is primarily triggered by homodimerization \\[[@CR3]\\], which is induced by GH or PRL binding. Since the structures of hGH and PRL contain no tertiary symmetry, in forming their respective complexes with the ECD homodimers, the hormones employ opposite faces utilizing surface epitopes possessing quite different topographical and electrostatic features \\[[@CR4]-[@CR6]\\]. As a consequence, in the case for both PRL and GH, the ECD binding sites have quite"
"Williamson states that, in my Perspective \\[[@pmed-0020326-b1]\\], I erred in pointing out that S\u00f8rensen et al. \\[[@pmed-0020326-b2]\\] differentiated only between current smokers and nonsmokers. As Williamson notes in his letter \\[[@pmed-0020326-b3]\\], the point raised is precisely the analysis presented by the authors. Adequate treatment for cigarette smoking is crucial. Williamson relies on a computer simulation to suggest that treatment is not important, but the plain facts demonstrate otherwise. Computer simulations are, of course, totally dependent on the underlying assumptions. Ample empirical data, coupled with strong biological knowledge, reinforce the importance of smoking as a confounding factor in studies of body weight and mortality. For example, in our own analysis, the link between overweight and mortality risk was substantially obscured by cigarette smoking, and emerged clearly when never smokers were analyzed separately \\[[@pmed-0020326-b4]\\]. The reasons for this are simple. Cigarette smoking is associated in many populations with a lower body mass index, and with higher mortality rates. Moreover, cigarette smoking causes several adverse health conditions that lead to lower body weight and higher mortality risk, such as chronic pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Individuals may often live with these conditions for many years, so that lagged analyses (conducted by S\u00f8rensen"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nAdaptation aftereffects are changes in the perception of a stimulus following exposure to another. Aftereffects are ubiquitous in the visual system, commonly found for many visual dimensions, such as luminance, contrast, spatial frequency, orientation and motion [@pone.0016251-Blakemore1], [@pone.0016251-Blakemore2], [@pone.0016251-Clifford1], [@pone.0016251-Gibson1], [@pone.0016251-Shapley1], [@pone.0016251-Anstis1], [@pone.0016251-Levinson1] among others. One key aspect of adaptation aftereffects is their selectivity, in that the size of the aftereffect is modulated by the similarity between adapting stimuli and test stimuli. This selectivity is thought to reflect the tuning of the mechanisms that encode these stimuli [@pone.0016251-Graham1]. According to this view, perception is based on a population of units, each tuned to a limited range of values for a stimulus property (e.g., orientation, direction of motion, spatial frequency). Adapting to a specific value of a stimulus property (e.g., high spatial frequency), affects only those units that respond to that value, and leaves others unaffected. Thus, adaptation has been successfully used as a psychophysical tool to infer the tuning properties of various mechanisms underlying the perception of basic visual properties such as orientation, spatial frequency and direction of motion [@pone.0016251-Blakemore1], [@pone.0016251-Blakemore3], [@pone.0016251-Sekuler1], [@pone.0016251-Regan1].\n\nAftereffects also occur for more complex stimuli, such as faces.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nThe well-established structure--function paradigm has been challenged by the discovery of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) (Dyson and Wright [@CR19]). It is suggested that about 40% of all proteins have disordered regions of 40 or more residues, with many proteins existing solely in the unfolded state (Tompa [@CR84]; Romero et al. [@CR76]). Although they lack stable secondary or tertiary structure elements, this large class of proteins plays a crucial role in various cellular processes (Theillet et al. [@CR83]; Wright and Dyson [@CR97]; van der Lee et al. [@CR89]; Uversky et al. [@CR87]). Disorder serves a biological role, where conformational heterogeneity granted by disordered regions enables proteins to exert diverse functions in response to various stimuli. Unlike structured proteins, which are essential for catalysis and transport, disordered proteins are crucial for regulation and signaling. Due to their intrinsic flexibility they can act as network hubs interacting with a wide range of biomolecules forming dynamic regulatory networks (Dyson and Wright [@CR19]; Tompa [@CR84]; Babu et al. [@CR2]; Flock et al. [@CR27]; Wright and Dyson [@CR95]; Uversky [@CR85]; Habchi et al. [@CR36]). Given the plethora of potential interaction partners, it is not surprising that the interaction of IDPs with binding partners"

These pressures can create a more stochastic environment that may result to increase stress for wildlife that are trying to cope with this variability. This elevated stress may lead to a more vulnerable and susceptible population as evident by the increased rate of emerging infectious diseases ([@ref10]). For example, the protozoan parasite, *Toxoplasma gondii*, a typical pathogen of terrestrial animals including humans, was found in 42% live and 62% dead southern sea otter (*Enhydra lutris nereis*) sampled between 1997 and 2001 ([@ref24]). Because it lives in nearshore habitats along the California coast from Point Conception to Half Moon Bay, the threatened southern sea otter may be particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures, such as pollution from freshwater runoff which was the major risk factor for *T. gondii* exposure ([@ref24]).\n\nPrior to near extirpation by the fur trade, sea otters were apex predators in nearshore ecosystems extending from the Pacific coast of the Baja Peninsula north and west to the northern islands of Japan ([@ref33]).

BCG significantly decreases recurrence rates\\[[@ref1]\\] and reduces the odds of progression by 27%.\\[[@ref2]\\] Guidelines from urological societies recommend maintenance BCG therapy for up to 3 years.\\[[@ref3]\\] However, intravesical BCG is a cause of bladder and systemic toxicity that is difficult to prevent and is responsible for treatment discontinuation.\\[[@ref4]\\] The consequences, as shown in previous retrospective studies, are that patients have an increased risk of recurrence.\\[[@ref5]\\] In the experience at our center, not only BCG interruption is partly due to toxicity but also patient\\'s and/or physician\\'s fear of complications. More recently, since 2013 a shortage of production of BCG has dramatically impaired our capacity to follow the current guidelines of maintenance therapy. The hypothesis suggested is that BCG discontinuance at any time during induction or consolidation impacts on prognosis independently of the cause (toxicity, personal choices).

"Introduction\n============\n\nDiverse migration patterns are almost ubiquitous within the animal kingdom. Migrations have evolved to maximize fitness in heterogeneous environments ([@evy102-B31]; [@evy102-B23]; [@evy102-B22]). Although these migrations are proximately induced by a combination of environmental factors, changes in physiology, morphology, and/or behavior ([@evy102-B14]; [@evy102-B12]), multiple studies have documented the genetic underpinnings of migration propensity (e.g., [@evy102-B73]; [@evy102-B87]). Nonetheless, comparative studies across a wide range of organisms are needed to understand the mechanisms of evolution leading to adaptive migrations ([@evy102-B48]).\n\nSalmonids can adopt migratory, partially migratory or resident life history strategies, with feeding migrations directed to sea (anadromy), lakes (adfluvial), or larger river sections (potamodromy), and spawning migrations back to natal freshwater stream habitats ([@evy102-B13]; [@evy102-B24]). Whether migratory salmonids originate from marine or freshwater ancestors have been under a long debate ([@evy102-B501]). Nor it is known whether migration, as a behavioral trait, drives evolution of physiology required for migration or vice versa. Ancestral diadromy might have induced the evolution of physiological adaptations that could drive migratory behavior even in currently landlocked species and populations ([@evy102-B70]).

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nHydrogen is the lightest element in the Periodic Table and the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe. Most hydrogen is employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe specialized macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), namely microglia, constitute 5--20% of total glial cells (Ransohoff and Perry, [@B59]; Kettenmann et al., [@B37]; Saijo and Glass, [@B63]). The lineage relationship between microglia and peripheral macrophages is well established (Yang et al., [@B72]; Saijo and Glass, [@B63]); it has been recently suggested that microglia originate from macrophages migrating into the CNS during early embriogenesis and that microglial cell population can locally expand in CNS (Ginhoux et al., [@B27]; Saijo and Glass, [@B63]). Our understanding of the key factors and molecular mechanisms responsible for microglia development and function is however still incomplete. In a healthy environment, resting microglia displays low expression levels of inflammatory molecules, but when activated, microglial cells abandon their ramified surveiling morphology, become ameboid, acquire phagocytic functions and migrate to the injured site to release inflammatory molecules (Polazzi and Monti, [@B57]; Saijo and Glass, [@B63]). Generally, microglial cells act as the primary responding cells for infectious and traumatic stimuli although their activation may also result in pathological forms of inflammation that contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (Glass et al., [@B28]; Perry et al., [@B56]; Saijo and Glass, [@B63]; Assi et al., [@B6])."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into all blood cell lineages, and are critical for the maintenance of homeostasis of the hematopoietic system.

Elucidating the molecular regulation of HSC quiescence should increase our understanding of mechanisms important for tissue regeneration and perhaps indicate how these may become dysregulated in pathological conditions. The quiescent state of HSCs is tightly controlled by both intrinsic molecular mechanisms and extrinsic signals from the microenvironment.

However, most cases of prostate cancer progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within a median of 18 to 24 months after castration \\[[@B2]\\]. Men with CRPC may experience symptomatic progression, which results in weight loss, fatigue, or pain from bone metastases, all of which can negatively affect quality of life.

Stroke (Cerebrovascular Insult-CVI) {#sec1dot1-brainsci-08-00032}\n----------------------------------------\n\nStroke (cerebrovascular insult-CVI) is defined as a neuropathological entity which occurs when the blood flow, which supplies the brain with oxygen and essential nutrients such as glucose as well as certain bioactive molecules, is partially or entirely perturbed \\[[@B1-brainsci-08-00032],[@B2-brainsci-08-00032]\\]. The vast majority of CVI cases are initiated by either a transient or a permanent occlusion of a major cerebral artery (i.e., \"ischemic stroke\"). Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in the central nervous system (CNS) can result in devastating, often irreversible consequences, eventually leading to morbidity and impaired neurological functions. The neuropathological outcome of the CVI depends on a multitude of factors such as duration and severity of the ischemia, the presence of collateral vasculature, the status of the systemic blood pressure, the etiology and localization, as well as confounding factors such as age, sex, multiple-medication and genetic background.

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nIn recent years, an increasing number of non-coding RNAs have been shown to participate in various regulatory cellular processes in both pro- and eukaryotes, mainly acting as post-transcriptional ribo-regulators. Although the abundant class of eukaryotic miRNAs mainly act by base-pairing to the 3\u2032- untranslated region (UTR) or coding sequence (CDS) of the cognate target-mRNA, most of the functionally characterized bacterial small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) target the 5\u2032-UTR of mRNAs ([@gks847-B1; @gks847-B2; @gks847-B3]). Besides several sRNAs which directly modulate protein activity, the majority of functionally characterized sRNAs from bacteria belong to the class of *trans*-encoded antisense RNAs. In most cases, they bind with only partial sequence complementarities to the 5\u2032-UTR of their target genes, and lead to translational repression by masking the ribosome binding site (RBS). Consequently, the association of the ribosomal 30S subunit to the RBS is inhibited, which is often coupled to target destabilization by RNases ([@gks847-B2]). However, repressive translational control and induction of mRNA degradation is not limited to direct base-pairing with the RBS, because some sRNA have been shown to target sequences that are located far upstream of the RBS, within the CDS or in the intergenic region of polycistronic mRNAs ([@gks847-B4; @gks847-B5; @gks847-B6; @gks847-B7;"

These strategies that are commonly used in almost all clinical settings are aimed to facilitate compliance in patients, simplify drug prescription, and decrease the drugs side effects, concomitant with increasing their efficacy ([@A19529R1], [@A19529R2]). In this context, concurrent administration of antinociceptive drugs can lead to achieving synergistic effects ([@A19529R3]).\n\nSeveral investigations have been carried out on physiological benefits of ascorbic acid and its applications as a therapeutic agent in various disease states. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of ascorbic acid as a cost-effective, convenient, and safe supplement for detoxifying narcotic drugs had been identified for many years ([@A19529R4]). Regarding the antinociceptive effects of ascorbic acid, it was earlier reported that a single dose of ascorbic acid intraperitoneally can produce antinociception by interaction with ionotropic glutamate receptors ([@A19529R5]).

Differences in the rescue time and the medical care may result in a higher proportion of patients surviving with a disability in HIC in comparison to LMIC ([@B13]). Interestingly, the proportion of survivors patients remaining with disability following a severe TBI seems to be similar between LMIC and HIC, and patients LMIC shows better recovery after a mild or moderate TBI. The reduced levels of disability in LMIC may be partly explained by excess mortality following severe TBI, as well by the differences in the definition of disability between"

Antimicrobials are widely used in animal agriculture as therapeutic, prevention, control, and growth promotion agents [@pone.0080575-VandenBogaard1]. Although not without controversy, several reports have indicated that antimicrobial use in food animals has been associated with subsequent development of resistance to antimicrobials in bacterial pathogens from humans [@pone.0080575-Fey1], [@pone.0080575-Angulo1], [@pone.0080575-Lyons1]. Various intervention strategies have been proposed or established by regulatory organizations around the world in an attempt to address this problem. Such strategies include: 1) banning of antibiotics as agricultural growth promoters [@pone.0080575-Grave1], [@pone.0080575-Wierup1], 2) removing certain antibiotic classes from the market, and 3) recommending that some classes of antibiotics never be approved for food animal use [@pone.0080575-U1].

"1.. Introduction\n================\n\nChronic diarrhoea is a significant clinical problem estimated to affect up to 5% of the population \\[[@b1-sensors-13-11899]\\]. There are many causes for chronic diarrhea, but bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) is one of the commonest \\[[@b2-sensors-13-11899]\\]. Bile acids are essential for the emulsification and subsequent digestion of fat. More than 98% of bile acids produced are reabsorbed back in to circulation, with less than 2% lost in faeces \\[[@b3-sensors-13-11899]\\]. If this process of reabsorption is perturbed either through disease, surgical removal of a length of bowel or through defects in certain regulatory proteins, then, the excess bile that is not reabsorbed spills over into the colon resulting in symptoms of diarrhea \\[[@b4-sensors-13-11899]\\]. The excess bile acids can be 'mopped up' or sequestered effectively using medication known as bile acid sequestrants. Although common, BAD is under diagnosed partly as it requires nuclear medicine imaging and ingestion of a radioactive capsule (selenium 75 tagged to homochlorotauric acid---SeHCAT). The SeHCAT retention test involves a synthetically tagged isotope, which is swallowed and diluted within the bile acid circulation and thus able to track its movements. This is the accepted gold standard to diagnose BAD, but the cost is prohibitive---approximately \u00a3210 (\\$320) per"

More recently, hypofractionated stereotactic body or ablative radiation therapy (SBRT, SABR) is increasingly used for e.g., early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and oligometastatic diseases \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\]. SBRT is characterized by intensified deposition of radiation doses into one or few circumscribed regions in a single or few fractions \\[[@CR4]\\]. In NSCLC e.g., a biologically effective dose (BED) of \u2265 100Gy is aimed in 1-8 fractions (based on tumor localization) with excellent local control rates \\[[@CR5], [@CR6]\\].

This is of great interest considering that the incidence of IUGR (defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile) worldwide is estimated to be 15.5%, and that number is greatly underestimated \\[[@B4]\\].

"1. Introduction {#section0005}\n===============\n\nLentiviruses have infected several mammalian species including humans (human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2), non-human primates (simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV\\'s)) and cats (feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)), sometimes affecting a significant proportion of the host population (for reviews see [@bib1], [@bib2]). Despite their relatively wide distribution, the transmission of lentiviruses is generally not very efficient. After inoculation, the virus enters host target cells via interaction with one or more cellular receptors. For HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV, CD4 is used as the primary receptor while chemokine receptors like CCR-5 or alternatively CXCR-4 are required as secondary receptor. Similarly, FIV enters its target cell using CD134 as a primary and CXCR-4 as a co-receptor. Interference with viral entry by vaccine-induced antibodies or antiviral therapy has been one of the major goals in the development of lentiviral intervention strategies. In spite of huge investments, success in the field of lentivirus vaccine development has been limited and in some cases the use of experimental lentiviral vaccines proved to be counterproductive: it rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection. Here we review reported examples of vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility to virus infection in general and lentivirus infection in particular, as well as currently"
"1. Introduction {#s1}\n===============\n\nCorticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tau pathology and distinctive clinical manifestations including asymmetric akinetic-rigid syndrome and higher cortical dysfunctions such as ideomotor apraxia, cortical sensor loss, and alien limb ([@bb001]; [@bb002]; [@bb003]). Clinical features related to dysfunctions in the basal ganglia are also present in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), but are generally symmetric and associated with impairment of infratentorial structures (vertical gaze palsy and early falls) ([@bb004]). Apart from such differences in clinical presentation, an overlap in symptoms has been reported between CBD and PSP, which makes a differential diagnosis between these neurodegenerative disorders challenging ([@bb003]; [@bb005]). Moreover, the classic neuropathology of CBD is found in patients who presented with progressive aphasia or frontotemporal dementia, making it difficult to maintain the term CBD as a unified clinicopathological entity. The evidence of this poor clinicopathological correlation has led to the use of the term corticobasal syndrome (CBS) in clinically diagnosed CBD cases ([@bb006]).\n\nIn addition to characteristic clinical symptoms, previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported distinct neuroimaging findings of clinically or pathologically diagnosed CBD (CBS/CBD), including asymmetric atrophy in the cerebral cortex and peduncle with dominance contralateral"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nIn recent years, as various cardiovascular diseases, obesity et al. become more and more universal, consumers have become more concerned about the possible health effects of excess fat in meat products. The amount of adipocyte growth (relative to muscle) is a major factor in determining the carcass merit and quality of the meat animal. Adipocytes mainly differentiate from preadipocytes in adipose tissue. So many studies about preadipocytes were conducted to explore the possible fat metabolism mechanisms and impact factors. Through the mechanisms and impact factors, fat metabolism can be regulated.\n\nCyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a second messenger important in many biological processes. cAMP has been shown to mediate the hormonal regulation of lipid metabolism in fat cells from adipose tissue \\[[@CR1]\\]. Fatty acid released from adipocytes is regulated by intracellular cAMP. Adipose tissue lipolysis is dependent on the intracellular concentration of cAMP, which is determined at the levels of both synthesis and degradation. Moreover, the cAMP analogue (dibutyryl cyclic AMP, dbcAMP) has the similar function of cAMP. Azarnia et al. found that addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and caffeine to already differentiated adipocytes resulted in loss of lipid.

"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nFungi are present everywhere in the environment, including in water, on solid surfaces, on our skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Taxonomists estimate the existence of 1.5 to over 5 million fungal species, although only a small minority (\\<300 species) causes diseases in humans ([@B1]). Despite their ubiquitous presence, fungi rarely become invasive in healthy adults due to multiple levels of immune defenses. In contrast, fungal infections are common in newborns and can be particularly invasive in those born very prematurely ([@B2], [@B3]).\n\nA number of studies have investigated the functional characteristics of newborn immune cells \\[reviewed in Ref.

Developmental changes in some of the main immune pathways involved in responses against Candida are illustrated in Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}. During gestation, innate immune cells are skewed toward anti-inflammatory responses. Adaptive immune cells also lack immunological memory from prior exposure to antigens and are skewed toward a T helper 2 (Th2) effector profile. These changes are essential to prevent allogeneic maternal rejection and during the establishment of tolerance toward self-antigens. Moreover, the expansion and maturation of immune cells is incomplete in infants born very"

Despite the self-reactivity of Tregs, the role of TCR signalling in Treg biology has been controversial and is still not fully understood. Numerous reports support the idea that TCR signalling in Tregs is uncoupled from the signalling pathways described in conventional T cells[@b9][@b10]. The idea that TCR stimulation is blunted or deviated to maintain an anergic, suppressive Treg phenotype has received experimental support. These results raised questions whether TCR signalling is even required for Treg mediated suppression[@b11].

Among them, mRNA splicing is a crucial process through which noncoding introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome, composed of five snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins: U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs) and an assembly of accessory proteins ([@bib17], [@bib46]). This machinery recognizes short consensus sequences in the pre-mRNA, at the 5\u2032 splice site, the branchpoint sequence (BPS), and the 3\u2032 splice site. Alternative splicing plays an important role in conferring remarkable variety on the eukaryotic transcriptome through the differential usage of splice sites ([@bib21], [@bib35], [@bib47]). It has been suggested that abnormalities in mRNA splicing lead to many pathological conditions, such as cancer onset and progression ([@bib41], [@bib52]). For this reason, the inhibition of inadequate splicing is attracting attention as an important therapeutic strategy ([@bib5], [@bib14], [@bib29], [@bib33], [@bib40]).\n\nVarious studies to detect compounds with inhibitory activity on splicing have been performed, and these successfully identified several microorganism-derived compounds with activities that modulate mRNA splicing ([@bib8]).

"Introduction\n============\n\nThe occurrence of cancer generally results from the accumulation of inherited and somatic mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Breast cancer is characterized by a distinct metastatic pattern involving regional lymph nodes, the bone marrow, lungs and liver ([@b1-ijmm-35-03-0664]). It is thought that the incidence of breast cancer is the result of the abnormal expression of many genes ([@b2-ijmm-35-03-0664]), including cancer markers, identified after scoring the expression pattern of each gene. Although there has been extensive research on the gene markers of breast cancer, the results have not been uniform and share only a small number of genes in common ([@b3-ijmm-35-03-0664],[@b4-ijmm-35-03-0664]). Some genes associated with breast cancer mutations are also typically not detected through the analysis of differential expression, even though they are essential in the network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. The importance of these genes will thus not be disclosed in the detection of individual marker genes.\n\nBased on the shortcoming, a more effective means has adopted by combining gene expression measurements over groups of genes that fall within common pathways.

Despite their small number (2,654 mature miRs, miRBase release 22), they regulate a large fraction of the transcriptome. Their biogenesis involves their transcription as primary miRs (pri-miRs), which assume secondary self-complementary hairpin structures, that are processed in the nucleus by the DROSHA/DGCR8 microprocessor complex giving rise to precursor hairpin miRs (pre-miRs) \\[[@CR7]\\]. These pre-miRs are exported to the cytoplasm and further processed by Dicer to generate the mature miR duplex, composed by one 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 strands (-5p and -3p suffixes in miR names, respectively). This duplex is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains an Argonaute (AGO) protein, and the passenger"
"Introduction {#S0001}\n============\n\nWhen venturing abroad, media companies need to reconcile conflicting demands. Cross-border growth ideally provides opportunities for synergy and economies of scale (Chan-Olmsted & Chang, [2003](#CIT0019)). At the same time, media offerings constituting cultural products (Doyle, [2013](#CIT0027)) require local adaptation. Thus, an adequate balance of economic standardisation and cultural adaptation is particularly rewarding for the cross-border activities of media companies (Chalaby, [2009](#CIT0017); Shrikhande, [2001](#CIT0080); Von Rimscha et al., [2018](#CIT0087)). Working towards such a balance is in accordance with achieving ambidexterity (Han, [2007](#CIT0036)). An ambidextrous organisation is efficient in managing its current business and is also adaptive to change and diverging market demands (Raisch & Birkinshaw, [2008](#CIT0076)).\n\nThe analytical concept of organisational ambidexterity describes \"the ability of an organization to both explore and exploit\" (O'Reilly & Tushman, [2013](#CIT0069), p. 324). More precisely, the term captures the \"delicate trade-off\\[s\\] between exploration and exploitation\" (March, [1991](#CIT0060), p. 85). Exploration and exploitation demarcate various forms of organisational action that appear to work in opposite directions. Exploration and exploitation can be particularised, inter alia, as resource building vs. resource exploitation (Hsu, Lien, & Chen, [2013](#CIT0042)), innovative vs. adaptive learning (Auh & Menguc, [2005](#CIT0005); Benner & Tushman, [2003](#CIT0009)), diversification vs. focusing (Lavie, Stettner, &"

"Background\n==========\n\nChildhood overweight is becoming increasingly prevalent all over the world and this trend is seen as an alarming development by public health professionals. The most frequently stated reason for their concern is that overweight children tend to become overweight adults and that adult overweight is a strong risk factor for a number of chronic diseases \\[[@B1]\\]. Literature reviews show that most studies on the consequences of childhood overweight have indeed focused on early symptoms or risk factors for later chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease \\[[@B2]-[@B5]\\]. For overweight children and their parents, current overweight-related health problems, might be more reason for concern than the risk of adverse health effects in future. The objective of this study was to investigate the general health status of overweight children and the possible impact of overweight on diseases that have a high prevalence in childhood.\n\nIn a general population sample of 3,960 8-year-old children, we compared overweight to normal weight children with respect to the following indicators of general health: the RAND general health index, GP (general practitioner) visits, school absenteeism due to illness and health-related functional limitations. In addition, we studied respiratory infections, which are highly prevalent childhood illnesses,"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nProductivity assessments of research groups are increasingly relevant. There are limited funds to foment research activities and a strong competitiveness to obtain part of it. An accurate research productivity assessment would make possible to allocate funds meritocratically. The problem is that research productivity assessment is indeed a daunting task. This is because it involves both qualitative and quantitative analysis of several characteristics, most of them subjective in nature. Besides, there is no consensus on the metrics to be used in the analysis and then, depending on the chosen ones, the assessment may produce quite different results.\n\nWhat sharply distinguishes Brazil from other countries is its natural and cultural diversity [@pone.0094541-McHenry1]. This diversity can also be found in science: there are a number of high standard graduate programs with unique characteristics spread throughout the territory.

The rings contain post-translationally introduced thioether-bridged amino acids, so called lanthionines. The most studied lantibiotic, which has also found commercial application, is nisin. Nisin has been successfully used for over 50 years as a food preservative without significant resistance development in food pathogens (Gravesen et al., [@B9]; Kramer et al., [@B17]).\n\nPrecursor nisin is composed of a 23 amino acid leader peptide followed by a modifiable 34 amino acid core peptide part (Figure [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). The leader peptide is a recognition signal for the modification enzymes NisB and NisC (Xie et al., [@B40]; Mavaro et al., [@B28]; Khusainov et al., [@B14]) and the transporter NisT (van der Meer et al., [@B37]). It furthermore keeps the fully modified precursor nisin inactive (Kuipers et al., [@B20]; van der Meer et al., [@B37]). Nisin contains one lanthionine ring and four (methyl)lanthionine rings that are introduced enzymatically.

These zoonotic viruses have been initially believed to be exclusively rodent-borne. However, in recent years a large number of novel hantaviruses has been identified in shrews, moles and bats \\[[@B2-viruses-06-00340]\\]. Human disease seems to be caused exclusively by certain rodent-borne hantaviruses. Their transmission to humans is mediated via inhalation of aerosolized excreta from persistently infected rodent hosts. Following the distribution of the causative hantaviruses, two different clinical syndromes have been described in the Old World and New World. The Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas is characterized by a very high case fatality rate of up to 35%, whereas the case fatality rate of the Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in Europe and Asia ranges from 0.1% to 15% \\[[@B3-viruses-06-00340],[@B4-viruses-06-00340]\\].\n\nIn Europe, hantavirus infections are, for a long time, found in Fennoscandia, Russia and the Balkan region.

"More than 1 million people in the United States were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2015, and there were an estimated 37,600 new HIV infections in 2014 ([@x24748307-20180925-01-bibr5]). Although the rates of new HIV infections in the US have decreased overall, this trend is not found across all subgroups. Men who have sex with men remain the largest subpopulation affected by HIV in the US, and younger people (age 20--29 years) accounted for the greatest number of new infections in 2016 ([@x24748307-20180925-01-bibr5]). Racial and ethnic groups are also disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. African Americans (AA) are the racial group most affected by HIV/AIDS in the US. In 2015, 48% of people diagnosed with AIDS living in the US were AA ([@x24748307-20180925-01-bibr5]). In 2014, AAs accounted for 53% of the HIV/AIDS-related deaths that year ([@x24748307-20180925-01-bibr5]).

Two main groups can be distinguished among these derived structures: steroids, i.e., tetracyclic compounds based on the perhydro-1,2-cyclopentano-phenanthrene moiety, and pentacyclic triterpenoids possessing a 5-ring carbon skeleton in various arrangements. Steroids contain a characteristic class of compounds with a hydroxyl group at C-3 called sterols. Plant sterols can exist in plants in a basic free form, but also as esters with fatty or phenolic acids, or as glycosides and acylated steryl glycosides \\[[@B3-molecules-24-02907],[@B4-molecules-24-02907]\\].

"Valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE) may occur in 16%-80% of patients receiving valproate. The range of incidence is wide due to variation in definition and setting. This adverse reaction can be either asymptomatic or presented with symptoms such as lethargy, drowsiness, and disorientation ([@B1]). Most of the reports have originated from neurology centers, but some recent reports have been received from psychiatric centers. Symptoms of VHE, such as lethargy, retarded motor symptom, or confusion may be misdiagnosed with exacerbation of current mood disorder ([@B2]). As a result, the doctor may increase the dose of valproate, which in turn can result in worsening the patient\\'s condition. Hence, medical team awareness may prevent further complications. Various risk factors have been identified that correlate with VHE, which include age younger than two or over 65 years, taking multiple antiepileptics (especially phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and topiramate), developmental disability (such as autistic spectrum), vegetarian or vegan diets, urea cycle disorder, and hypercatabolic state (eg, burn and trauma).\n\nAlso, some other medications may cause hyperammonemia encephalopathy and the exact relevance with valproate may not be possible.

"There has been intense interest in the development of nanomaterials as therapeutic and diagnostic agents, owing to their unique properties including large, specific drug loading capacity[@b1], strong superparamagnetism[@b2], or efficient photoluminescence[@b3].

"Introduction\n============\n\nSpinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a large group of inherited disorders presenting with cerebellar ataxia. Some patients may also have associated hyperkinetic movements, including dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, and tremor. SCA type 31 (SCA31) is an adult-onset autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder showing a late-onset, relatively pure cerebellar form of ataxia and the degeneration of Purkinje cells ([@B1], [@B2]). Recently, Nakamura et al. reported that one of 44 patients with SCA31 presented with \"facial dystonia\", but the details were not described ([@B3]).\n\nBlepharospasm is a form of focal dystonia characterized by involuntary orbicularis oculi muscle spasms ([@B4], [@B5]). Studies of patients with blepharospasm have demonstrated hyperactivity of various brain regions, including the lenticular nucleus and thalamus ([@B4]). Recent studies also demonstrated cerebellar involvement in blepharospasm patients ([@B4], [@B6]).\n\nThus far, blepharospasm has been reported in patients with several neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy ([@B7]) and SCA types 1 ([@B8], [@B9]) and 3 ([@B10]). Although Cardoso et al. stated that blepharospasm in SCA3 patients may be associated with lesions of the basal ganglia ([@B10]), the pathologic mechanisms of blepharospasm in SCA patients remain unclear.

"The type of questions biologists ask depend on the interests and curiosity of each scientist.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), as a mean to assess genome-wide gene expression profiles, is one example of a method that has revolutionized research in biology. The possibility of collecting genome-wide expression data offered an unbiased way to integrate genotypic variation, phenotypic variation, and the environment; this has made RNA-seq a very popular tool in a wide range of biological disciplines, from ecology to developmental biology to quantitative genetics. However, RNA-seq remains prohibitive for many laboratories due to the high cost of library preparation using commercial kits.\n\nIn the last couple of years, some attempts have been made to reduce the cost and increase the throughput of RNA-seq library preparation.

"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nPlatelets are key blood components that are continuously generated in the bone marrow through fragmentation of the edges of megakaryocytes ([@B1]). In addition to their canonical role in hemostasis, platelets participate in a variety of pathological processes, including chronic inflammation and cancer ([@B2]). As the incidence of both cancer and chronic inflammatory disorders rise in an age-dependent manner, the influence that aging may exert on platelet function has become particularly relevant ([@B3]). So far, however, the mechanisms involved in this age-dependent modulation of platelets or other components of the hemostasis cascade remain poorly characterized. Similarly, the age-dependent factors that modulate the interaction between platelets and cancer cells are largely unknown. Based on the capacity of senescent cells to actively modify the tissue microenvironment through the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, herein we speculate about the existence of a functional link between cellular senescence and platelets that may help explain the increased incidence of cancer and thrombotic diseases in older individuals.\n\nThe Complex Involvement of Platelets in Cancer {#S2}\n==============================================\n\nThe functional connection between cancer and platelets has been recognized since the late nineteenth century, when an association between the occurrence of certain solid tumors and the development of"

"Increasing the length of working life is a major policy goal in many countries. In the United States, the Social Security retirement age has been increased from age 65 to age 66 for individuals born in 1943--1954, and it will increase further for the cohorts born in 1955 and in later years ([@CIT0002]). Yet how the length of working life has developed in general, and at older ages in particular, is not currently known. Speci\ufb01c transitions during working life have been studied extensively, such as the transition from retirement to work. In contrast, the question of how much accumulated time is spent in work at older ages has received less attention, despite its importance for policy-makers ([@CIT0011]).\n\nLike life expectancy, the duration of working life can be studied from a cohort perspective or from a period perspective ([@CIT0025]). In the cohort perspective, the average length of the working trajectories of individuals born during a given time is considered, for example, the duration of the working lives of individuals born in 1940. In the period perspective, the conditions of a single year (or a few years) are assumed to prevail during the lifetime of a synthetic cohort, resulting in arti\ufb01cial working"
"Background\n==========\n\nRecent reports suggest that within the heterogeneous population that constitutes a melanoma, certain cell types exhibit molecular and functional features similar to stem cells. These melanoma-initiating cells (MICs) have the ability of unlimited self-renewal, multilineage differentiation and the potential to initiate and maintain tumor growth \\[[@B1]\\]. Furthermore, MICs are believed to confer chemoresistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and newly developed molecularly-targeted drugs \\[[@B2],[@B3]\\]. Therefore, defining the molecular and biochemical pathways that support MICs is of critical importance for the development of more efficient targeted therapies. We have previously shown that the HEDGEHOG (HH) signaling is required for melanoma growth \\[[@B4]\\] and for survival and expansion of MICs \\[[@B5]\\]. Here we investigate the mechanism by which inhibition of the HH signaling leads to a decrease of MIC stemness, addressing the role of the transcription factor SOX2.\n\nMaterials and methods\n=====================\n\nMICs were enriched by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting using the metabolic marker Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) and by establishing melanoma spheres in non-adherent culture conditions from 20 human melanomas. Expression of SOX2 and of HH pathway components was determined by real time PCR and Western blot analysis. Modulation of the HH signaling was performed by stable expression of lentiviral vectors"

However, the influence of these autoantibodies on the clinical status and disease activity of patients with RA has yet to be fully clarified.\n\nRF and anti-CCP have recently been shown to influence the efficacy of some non-tumor necrosis factor (non-TNF) biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) \\[[@CR5]--[@CR9]\\]. However, the influence of these autoantibodies on the efficacy of TNF inhibitors, the first biological DMARDs approved for RA, has been controversial \\[[@CR10]--[@CR16]\\].\n\nThe RISING study was a randomized, double-blind trial that demonstrated the usefulness of dose escalation of infliximab (IFX) in RA \\[[@CR17]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nCytotoxic CD8+ T cell (CTL) responses play an essential role in antiviral immunity by eliminating infected cells after recognition of virus-derived peptide ligands on the cell surface ([@B1]). In contrast to virus-specific antibodies that can neutralize viruses by recognizing limited structural components on the surface of the pathogen, CD8+ T cell responses can essentially be directed against any viral protein that is produced within an infected cell as long as it contains epitopes presented by MHC class I. Thus, there is an increasing interest in developing vaccines that can raise efficient antiviral CD8+ T cell responses ([@B2]).\n\nModified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) is a highly attenuated strain of vaccinia virus (VACV) that has lost \\~15% of the VACV genome, along with the ability to replicate in most mammalian cells ([@B3]).

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\n*Acinetobacter baumannii* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* are two of the main superbug bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections in severely ill patients. They cause a wide spectrum of infections from skin and wound infections to septicemia and hospital outbreaks worldwide; both organisms are resistant to several classes of antibiotics making their treatment very difficult \\[[@CR1]\\]. The MDR pattern can be transferred to the other organisms that initially do not show such resistance \\[[@CR2]\\]. In addition, biofilm production in *A. baumannii* and *P. aeruginosa* encourages increased colonization and persistence in hospital environments leading to higher rates of device-related infections \\[[@CR3]\\]. To solve the problem of limited therapeutic options, it is very vital to find new therapeutic strategy to combat *A. baumannii* infections.\n\nIt is well known now that quorum sensing (QS), a cell-to-cell communication system, regulates the expression of several virulence and survival genes in many organisms at high cell densities using *N*-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signaling molecules; thus, QS plays key role in the establishment of microbial infections \\[[@CR4]\\].

"A 77-year-old male patient presented with a dark-brown nodular lesion, which grew within an oval melanocytic nevus of 6\u00d74 cm^2^ in size and located on the skin of the lower abdomen. The nodule appeared 6 months earlier and reached the size of 2 cm in diameter. The growing cutaneous finding manifested with the bleeding sore and crust. The nevus was excised entirely together with the nodule. The histopathologic examination revealed the nodular type of amelanotic melanoma, which was ulcerated and classified as Clark II and Breslow IV (5 mm of infiltration thickness). Essentially, no clear margins were noted both vertically and horizontally, and the infiltration of the tumor encompassed the border and subcutaneous tissue. Additionally, some satellite metastases were detected subcutaneously. The most of laboratory tests stayed within the normal range and only erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated (70--90 mm/h). No increase was observed in concentrations of tumor markers (CEA, Ca125, total-PSA), and diagnostic imaging (chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound, head CT \\[computed tomography\\]) detected no abnormalities. One month after the surgical excision of the primary lesion, a fine needle aspiration of inguinal lymph nodes was performed bilaterally.

"Free molecular oxygen (O~2~) is released by photosynthesis into the atmosphere and is essential for all breathing animals. With exception of data for the last 800,000 years from air inclusions in polar ice, little direct information is available about concentration and isotope composition of ancient atmospheric O~2~. This is due to the limited interaction between air molecular oxygen and the lithosphere.\n\nAmong the rare rocky materials that contain atmospheric oxygen[@b1][@b2][@b3] there are particular types of micrometeorites (microscopic extraterrestrial dust particles) called cosmic spherules[@b4].

"INTRODUCTION {#sec1-1}\n============\n\nNasal polyps are common tear-drop shaped growths that form in nose or paranasal sinuses. These can develop in all paranasal sinuses but the region of middle meatus and osteomeatal complex is most favored. These are often linked to allergies and long term infections especially fungal sinusitis. Most people with nasal polyps have rhinorrhoea, sneezing, anosmia / hyposmia and post-nasal drip. There may be associated deviated nasal septum(DNS), enlarged turbinates or atopies. Generally topical nasal steroid drops with oral antihistamine are highly effective in relieving symptoms. Sometimes short-term systemic steroid courses are also prescribed. However in refractory and uncontrolled cases surgery is the last resort to improve quality of life.\n\nConventional nasal polypectomy has lost its charm due to high rate of recurrence. Ankema et al.[@ref1] have found that although 12 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate nasal drops reduced the need for sinus surgery in patients with nasal polyposis and chronic rhinosinusitis but 14 out of 27 patients still required surgery. Nowadays FESS has emerged as a treatment of choice for nasal polyposis and chronic rhino sinusitis that is not responsive to aggressive medical treatment.

"Chironomids\n===========\n\nChironomids (*Diptera*; *Chironomidae*), also known as non-biting midges, are the most abundant insects in freshwater habitats ([@B2]). Members of the *Chironomidae* family are opportunistic colonizers of all aquatic environments. They undergo a complete metamorphosis of four life stages: eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults. Females of the genus *Chironomus* lay egg masses at the interface between water and air, usually glued to water plants or rocks. Each egg mass contains hundreds of eggs wrapped in a gelatinous matrix, composed mainly of glycoprotein and chitin ([@B8]; [@B21]; [@B34]). The matrix protects the eggs and is settled by various bacterial species ([@B22]; [@B40]; [@B41], [@B42]; [@B14]; [@B23]). The larvae of most *Chironomus* species pass through four stages that can be diagnosed by body length and diameter of the head box ([@B14]). Larvae at the first stage are planktonic and attracted to light; when they find a suitable place they settle and become benthic and no longer respond to light ([@B36]). The larvae transform into pupae and the adults emerge into the air. Chironomid adults create aerial swarms for mating, after which the females lay the egg masses ([@B6]).\n\nChironomids are found worldwide, from Nepal glaciers at an altitude of 6,600 m"

Malaria can be caused by any of several different plasmodia species capable of infecting humans; of these, *Plasmodium falciparum* is the most malignant. Upon transmission to the human host by an Anopheles mosquito, plasmodial sporozoites migrate to and infect liver hepatocytes. Following the asymptomatic liver stage, merozoites are released into the bloodstream where they infect host red blood cells (RBCs). It is the RBC stage of infection that is responsible for all symptoms of disease. Upon entry into the host RBC the malaria parasite progresses through a 48 hour lifecycle. At the end of the 48 hour intra-erythrocytic lifecycle the host RBC is ruptured and newly formed merozoites are released into the serum to invade new host RBCs [@pone.0101041-Bei1].

"INTRODUCTION {#SEC1}\n============\n\n*Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (GC) is the cause of gonorrhoea, one of the most frequent sexually transmitted diseases. The obligate human-specific pathogens colonize the mucosal surface of the urogenital tract but may also disseminate into the blood stream to cause disseminated gonococcal disease. The incidence of gonococcal infections increased in the last years to more than 100 million annually ([@B1]). In addition, multi-resistant gonococci spread globally which may result in non-treatable gonorrhoea in the near future.\n\nMany different factors have been characterized in gonococci that support the pathogenic potential of GC. Type IV pili mediate the initial attachment to mucosal cells and are therefore important colonization factors ([@B2]). Proteins in the outer membrane like the family of opacity-associated (Opa) proteins mediate the initial attachment to, invasion into and traversal through epithelial cells ([@B3],[@B4]). To acquire iron, GC takes up host transferrin and lactoferrin by membrane-located transferrin and lactoferrin binding proteins. GC are naturally competent for the uptake of their own DNA which is recognized by virtue of the small 10 bp 5\u2032-GCCGTCTGAA DNA uptake sequence (DUS) ([@B5]). Approximately 2000 copies of the DUS are present in GC, indicating a frequent uptake and integration of free DNA into the genome"
"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nIn recent years, *mental rotation*, a component of spatial ability, has become a central issue of cognitive psychology. Mental rotation is the ability to mentally manipulate two- or three-dimensional objects that may be rotated in any direction or translated in space ([@R41]). Due to the vast involvement of spatial factors in sports, mental rotation seems to share simxilar subprocesses with motor execution. Recent studies have revealed that sports experts have an advantage in terms of mental rotation, and thus, the performance of mental rotation has been regarded as a reliable predictor of sports expertise level for some elite athletes ([@R15]; [@R47]).\n\nConcerning the processes of mental rotation in sports experts, the theory of embodied cognition has been highlighted in numerous studies. This concept suggests that an individual's cognitive ability is influenced by their environmental perception, and thus, that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the interactions between the body and the environment ([@R49]). It has been shown that in the activities that have considerable spatial reasoning demands, individuals' mental representations of their body is often continuously updated with regard to its position or movement. Athletes are asked to manipulate complex mental representations, such that mental rotation abilities"

"1.. Introduction {#sec1}\n================\n\nThe purine-biosynthetic pathway is ultimately responsible for the generation of inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate from \u03b1-[d]{.smallcaps}-ribose-5-phosphate (Zhang *et al.*, 2008[@bb37]) and provides the essential purine nucleotides required for DNA replication and cell division. The pathway consists of ten enzyme-catalyzed steps in vertebrates (Buchanan & Hartman, 1959[@bb5]) and 11 in *Escherichia coli* (Mueller *et al.*, 1994[@bb26]). In this pathway, adenylosuccinate lyase (PurB; EC 4.3.2.2) catalyzes the breakdown of 5-aminoimidazole-4-(*N*-succinylcarboxamide) ribotide (SAICAR) to 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) and fumarate (Fig. 1[\u25b6](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). PurB demonstrates dual substrate specificity and can also break down adenylo\u00adsuccinate to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and fumarate (Fig. 1[\u25b6](#fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}); therefore, it also determines the levels of AMP and fumarate in the cell *via* the purine-nucleotide cycle. In humans, mutations in PurB and adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency have profound effects on the central nervous system (Spiegel *et al.*, 2006[@bb31]). It has been predicted on the basis of bioinformatics comparisons and metabolic reconstructions that the *purB* gene encodes an essential enzyme activity in *Staphylococcus aureus* (Heinemann *et al.*, 2005[@bb15]), although we note that it would be important to genetically and chemically validate this prediction.

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nOut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients whose arrests were witnessed by a bystander, who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by a layperson, and who experienced early defibrillation owing to initial shockable rhythm are expected to survive after resuscitation \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\]. Consequently, in the case of OHCA patients with the appropriate post-cardiac arrest care, such as goal-directed therapy, early coronary intervention for cardiac protection, and therapeutic hypothermia for brain protection, good outcomes are anticipated. Nevertheless, under some circumstances, it is difficult to make the decision to sustain or stop CPR in OHCA patients, which raises difficult problems for health care providers. Per the recent advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) guidelines, the duration of effort put forth for resuscitation should be based on an individual's situation, which also depends on the CPR leader's judgment. In addition, the condition and outcome of the OHCA patient during CPR are often not clear. Frequently, unnecessary CPR has been performed without having definitive information about the status of the OHCA patient.\n\nWhen OHCA patients are administered ACLS, the peripheral venous line should be secured because of the administration of epinephrine.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nSince 1995, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) has organized annual mass treatment with ivermectin in sixteen endemic African countries, with the aim to control eye and skin disease due to onchocerciasis [@pone.0115886-Amazigo1]. Following the first reports of elimination of onchocerciasis from three savanna foci in West Africa with mass treatment alone and good progress towards this goal in two Nigerian foci [@pone.0115886-Diawara1]--[@pone.0115886-Traore1], APOC has taken up the additional objective of eliminating infection, where possible [@pone.0115886-African1]. To achieve elimination, it has been suggested that APOC should increase the frequency of mass treatment from annual to 6-monthly, following the example of the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA), which by means of 6-monthly and 3-monthly mass treatment has rapidly interrupted transmission in the majority of the American foci [@pone.0115886-Cupp1], [@pone.0115886-Sauerbrey1]. Shorter and more intensive mass treatment programs are attractive as they speed up elimination, minimize the risk of interruption and emergence of drug resistance, which should be politically appealing to health officials [@pone.0115886-Stolk1]. However, increasing the frequency of mass treatment would also require major initial investments from APOC, endemic countries, and Merck, the pharmaceutical company donating ivermectin for onchocerciasis control.

Malaria is a disease which spreads through the bite of female *anopheles* mosquitoes, who carry the infection moieties (sporozoites) of parasites belonging to the *Plasmodium* genus ([@B1]). The greater morbidity and mortality related to human malaria infections reported by World Health Organization (WHO), is due to the wide range of hosts, mainly affecting humans with a high host tropism. 216 million cases of malaria infection was reported across the world in 2016, with a death toll of 445,000. In comparison, 237 million cases were reported in 2010 and 211 million cases were reported in 2015 ([@B2]). The death incidence rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is more than 85% in children \\<5 years of age ([@B3]).\n\nThe pathophysiology and molecular mechanism of malaria has been revealed, contributing to improving our understanding of malaria biology.

"Introduction\n============\n\nSclerosing stromal tumor (SST) is a rare benign ovarian neoplasm of the sex cord stromal category first delineated as a distinct ovarian sex cord stromal tumor entity in 1973 by Chalvardjian and Scully.[@B1] Most patients afflicted with SST present with nonspecific symptoms related to an adnexal mass. The tumor, with rare exceptions, is hormonally inactive. Diagnosis of SST can be confirmed by postoperative pathologic examination. It is important to perform differential diagnoses of SST relative to other sex cord stromal tumors including fibroma, thecoma and lipoid cell tumors.[@B2] It is distinguished from other ovarian stromal tumors by the production of collagen, a pseudolobular pattern, and it tends to occur in the second and third decades of patient life.[@B3]\n\nHerein, we present two cases of SST occurred in postmenopausal women with brief review of literature.\n\nCase Report\n===========\n\n1.

All FA complementation groups (discussed below) except FA-B are inherited autosomally \\[[@B1],[@B2]\\]. FA prevalence is estimated to be 1--5 per million and the frequency of heterozygous carriers to be 1 in 300 \\[[@B3],[@B4]\\]. Notwithstanding the small number of FA patients, this disease constitutes a dynamic research area because the FA pathway plays a crucial role in preventing genomic instability and provides an attractive model for understanding the interplay between DNA repair and ubiquitin biology in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy (reviewed in \\[[@B5]-[@B15]\\]).\n\nThe clinical course and the treatment of FA have been extensively reviewed elsewhere \\[[@B3],[@B4],[@B16]\\]. Clinically, FA is characterized by childhood onset aplastic anemia, increased cancer/leukemia susceptibility and developmental defects. Typically, FA patients develop bone marrow failure leading to aplastic anemia during the first decade of life and at least 20% develop malignancies. Most commonly, these include acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, but also head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, gynecological squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and liver, brain, skin and renal tumors \\[[@B17]-[@B19]\\].

Introduction {#sec1-cells-09-00532}\n===============\n\nUtilization of human pluripotent stem cells has become important for recapturing human development and for disease analysis that would provide a basis for regenerative medicine and drug discovery. In particular, the discovery of human induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) \\[[@B1-cells-09-00532]\\] enabled researchers to overcome the issue of direct inaccessibility to the human brain, which has been a major barrier in patient cell-based research. It is not an overstatement to say that analysis and cell therapy using neural cells differentiated from patient-derived iPS cells has increasingly become more attainable \\[[@B2-cells-09-00532],[@B3-cells-09-00532]\\]. Meanwhile, some technical problems concerning neuronal induction still remain. First, it is necessary to increase the purity of the target neurons.

EAMT in Taiwan has been used for decades and experienced increasing demand in the past few years. Ever since the National Aeromedical Approval Center (NAAC), formerly known as National Aeromedical Consultation Center (NACC), was established on October 1, 2002, EAMT in Taiwan had started a new page.

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nCongenital leukemia, defined as a leukemia that occurs within 4 to 6 weeks of birth, is rare. Excluding Down syndrome-related transient neonatal myeloproliferation, its incidence is less than 1% of all childhood leukemia ([@B1], [@B2]). The diagnostic criteria include the presence of immature leukemic blasts in the blood and in extrahematopoietic tissues and the absence of congenital infections (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, rubella, and bacterial infections), hypoxia, and hemolytic disease, which may produce a similar clinical and hematological picture. In addition, there may be absence of chromosomal disorders that may be associated with unstable hematopoiesis, such as trisomy 21 ([@B3]).\n\nAlthough its biology and natural history are still under investigation, it is clear that the leukemic process originated in utero even in infants diagnosed within the first few months of life ([@B2]). In infants with congenital leukemia under the age of 1 month, the 6-month survival rate is only one third despite aggressive chemotherapy ([@B4]). It has a higher mortality rate than any other congenital cancer, but recently some reports showed spontaneous remissions ([@B3], [@B5]).

"Background\n==========\n\nGrowing pressure from globalization on traditional agricultural production has led to a greater presence of large-scale corporate agriculture in many low income countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)\\[[@B1]\\], about half of the increase in pesticide use in developing countries that has occurred in the past several decades has been through use in large-scale agricultural industry. Because young women of reproductive age comprise an increasing proportion of the paid labor force within global agricultural industries more attention is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of occupational exposure to pesticides on reproductive health of these working women.\n\nComprehensive reviews by Sever et al. and Arbuckle et al. address the inconsistent and often controversial epidemiological evidence on the reproductive effects of occupational pesticide exposure, particularly in regard to fetal loss \\[[@B2],[@B3]\\].

"1. Introduction {#Section1}\n===============\n\nGlobal cerebral ischemia is a clinical outcome of cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation is essential for the treatment of cardiac arrest. However, patients experiencing the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest have high morbidity and mortality rates owing to a systemic ischemia/reperfusion response involving multiple organs. Brain injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is responsible for approximately two-thirds of the deaths in the post-cardiac arrest period [@B1]. Global cerebral ischemia during cardiac arrest and reperfusion after ROSC result in heterogeneous injury to the brain, and the hippocampus and brain cortex are the most vulnerable areas [@B2]. Mild therapeutic hypothermia has been proven to be effective for neurological protection after cardiac arrest in both experimental and clinical studies [@B3], but some other current treatments are limited. Therefore, many pharmacological neuroprotective drugs that focus on specific brain injury mechanisms after cardiac arrest have been developed and have shown benefits in preclinical studies.\n\nMitochondria are vital organelles in cells that not only produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for cellular functions but also participate in a number of intracellular processes such as cell division, oxidative response, metabolic signaling pathways, regulation of cytosolic Ca^2+^ concentration, and"

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\n*Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (also called Gc or the gonococcus) is a Gram-negative diplococcal bacterium and is the causative agent of the human sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea. No vaccines for gonorrhea exist in part because *N.gonorrhoeae* alters some of its surface elements, allowing it to evade the human immune system ([@b1],[@b2]). Gonococcal attachment to human epithelial cells is mediated primarily by pili, surface structures composed of multiple units of the protein pilin ([@b3],[@b4]). Pili mediate adherence to a number of different eukaryotic cell types, affect interactions with epithelia, endothelia and phagocytes ([@b5]), and are also required for full DNA transformation competence ([@b6]--[@b8]).\n\nPilin is encoded by the *pilE* gene present at a single expression locus in the strain FA1090.

"Malignant gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor in adults. Despite progress in brain tumor therapy, the prognosis for malignant glioma patients remains dismal. Standard treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma has increased the median overall survival (OS) by 15--20\u2009months ([@B1]), but tumor recurrence is inevitable. Salvage treatments upon recurrence are palliative at best and rarely provide significant survival benefit. Among the new treatments currently being investigated for malignant glioma, immunotherapy is theoretically attractive, because it offers the potential for high tumor-specific cytotoxicity ([@B2]). Although recent clinical trials of immunotherapy protocols for malignant gliomas focused on initiating and amplifying a host response with some clinical success, most of them failed to induce objective tumor shrinkage in patients ([@B2]). Antitumor activities of tumor cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and antibodies induced by these therapies are insufficient to overcome tumor growth because tumors have immune evasion mechanisms instigated by myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (T~reg~) ([@B3]).

Hyperinsulinemia may increase lipid synthesis and supply to muscles and the liver \\[[@B5-molecules-24-00046],[@B6-molecules-24-00046]\\]. The Randle glucose-fatty acid cycle may contribute to the acute manifestation of insulin resistance in hyperlipidemic states, such as obesity \\[[@B7-molecules-24-00046]\\]. Growth hormone, corticosteroids, and epinephrine are used to accelerate the release of fatty acids in adipose tissue, and through this cycle to inhibit muscle ingestion of glucose, leading to insulin insensitivity. In addition, excess glucocorticoid has been known to cause insulin resistance by inhibiting glucose transport \\[[@B8-molecules-24-00046]\\].\n\nMushrooms are a potential source for functional foods due to their bioactive and non-toxic ingredients.

"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nSimulated annealing (SA) algorithm, which was first independently presented as a search algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems in \\[[@B1], [@B2]\\], is a popular iterative metaheuristic algorithm widely used to address discrete and continuous optimization problems. The key feature of SA algorithm lies in means to escape from local optima by allowing hill-climbing moves to find a global optimum. One of the major shortages of SA is that it has several parameters to be tuned, and its performance is sensitive to the values of those control parameters. There are two special strategies for parameter tuning: the online parameter tuning and the off-line parameter tuning. In the online approach, the parameters are controlled and updated dynamically or adaptively throughout the execution of the SA algorithm \\[[@B3]--[@B7]\\], whereas in the off-line approach, the values of different parameters are tuned before the execution of the SA algorithm and are fixed during its execution. Fine-tuning parameter values is not trivial, and those parameters are quite often very poorly made by trial and error. So, SA algorithm, which has less parameter or is less sensitive to parameter setting, is very attractive for practical users.\n\nRecently, a metaheuristic algorithm called the list-based threshold-accepting"

"Introduction {#ss1}\n============\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a major challenge for the health care system ([@CIT0001]). It is the most common diagnosis among elderly inpatients, and it affects a large number of patients ([@CIT0002]). Approximately 14 million persons suffer from heart failure in Europe, and 4.8 million US citizens are estimated to have congestive heart failure ([@CIT0003]). HF is a complex syndrome that is caused by abnormalities of cardiac function or structure that impair the ability of the heart to fill or eject blood ([@CIT0004]). HF is expensive with average HF admission costs of \\$7,000--13,000 ([@CIT0005]) and associated with a significant mortality ([@CIT0006]). The death rates within 1 month are between 7% and 15% ([@CIT0007]).

In these applications, 1.5 MHz has been validated to be an effective stimulation frequency, and the applied intensities are within a range between 30 mW/cm^2^ and 100 mW/cm^2^. Accurate calibrations of ultrasound intensities have become important because treatment outcomes are highly dependent on the intensities and duration of LIPUS.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nWhether it is roaming on the safari or dozing by the fireplace, the ability to quickly detect threat (e.g., a tiger or a burning rug) and initiate appropriate responses can mean life or death for an organism. Decades of neuroscience research in emotion processing has reached a strong consensus: the amygdala extracts biological significance of a sensory cue and initiates and controls affective and motivational responses to the stimulus (LeDoux, [@B39], [@B40]; Adolphs, [@B1]). In terms of threat perception, a widely held view is that the amygdala projects emotionally charged outputs to the sensory cortex, thereby enabling perceptual analysis of potential danger (Phelps and LeDoux, [@B63]; Vuilleumier and Pourtois, [@B82]). These theories have been incorporated into neural models of emotional disorders, shedding important light on the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression (Davis, [@B14]; Rauch et al., [@B67]; Clark and Beck, [@B10]).\n\nHowever, striking findings have arisen recently, suggesting that threat processing can operate independently of the amygdala.

"Bladder cancer is the seventh most common cancer in the developed world, with tobacco smoking a major cause ( <http://www.wcrf.org/cancer_statistics/developed_countries_cancer_statistics.php>). Management of non-muscle-invasive and/or low-risk disease (pTa, papillary, or flat carcinoma *in situ*) focuses on prevention of progression and identification of patients likely to develop high-risk tumours (pT1G3, high grade, invading lamina propria) in order to offer them early, aggressive intervention, including radical cystectomy[@b1]. However, there is a likelihood of overtreating some pTa or pT1 tumours that would never have progressed to the more life-threatening muscle-invasive disease (pT2+, invading muscularis propria).

"Introduction\n============\n\nThe natural or innate immune system is present in some form in most living organisms and consists of mechanisms for defending the host against foreign invaders and for healing injured tissues. We now know that many of the mechanisms of resistance to infection are also involved in the individual\\'s response to noninfectious foreign substances and environmental stresses, including mechanical stretch. Furthermore, mechanisms that normally protect individuals and eliminate foreign substances are themselves capable of causing tissue injury and disease. This inherent defense network includes anatomical, physical and chemical barriers, circulating molecules, cells with specific phagocytic or lytic abilities, and soluble mediators that orchestrate the activities of each component and their interactions with the acquired immune system. Normally, this is a well integrated system of host defense and preservation of self-integrity, in which numerous cells and molecules function cooperatively.

Based on the WHO clinical classification system, HIV-infected patients are classified into four clinical stages from stage 1 (asymptomatic) to stage 4 (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS) ([@B3]). The main feature of stage 4 HIV infection is severe opportunistic infections such as pneumocystosis, cryptococcosis, and candidacies ([@B4]).\n\n*Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PJP) is a respiratory disease caused by a yeast-like fungus.

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nBurn injuries, particularly those at the full-thickness level, can develop into acute wounds that are difficult to manage and heal \\[[@CR1]\\]. Currently, standard treatment for burn injuries involves using silver-containing antibiotics to prevent infection \\[[@CR2]\\].

Additionally, medical dressings are used to maintain the hydration environment and air permeability of a burn injury \\[[@CR4]\\]. However, the aforementioned treatment methods cannot be used to alleviate inflammation or facilitate healing a burn injury.

"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nThe goal of speech motor control is intelligible speech sounds. These sounds, perceived as auditory feedback, provide critical information that allows the brain to detect errors in vocal output and initiate motor commands that correct for them ([@B35]; [@B40]). Speakers have been consistently shown to compensate for perturbations heard in their voice fundamental frequency (*F*~0~), intensity, and formant frequency ([@B15]; [@B41]; [@B46]; [@B7]; [@B72]; [@B60]). This compensatory process engages a large complex neural network of sensory, motor, and cognitive systems ([@B85]; [@B69]; [@B17]; [@B54]; [@B11], [@B10]). Our understanding of sensorimotor integration for voice control, however, is still far from clear.\n\nA growing body of literature has shown that, across participants, the ability to compensate for perturbations in voice auditory feedback is not equal, but rather varies as a function of expertise like singing. For example, a series of singing studies found that, when auditory feedback was perturbed in pitch during syllable singing, singers suppressed their vocal compensations for pitch perturbations to a lesser degree and were even able to completely ignore large pitch perturbations (i.e., produced almost no vocal compensation) compared to non-singers ([@B91], [@B92]; [@B90]).

Nowadays, sequenced genomes are compared based on conserved genes, polymorphic positions and/or annotations (16S rRNA, *rpoB*, *atpB*, etc.; [@msx200-B57]).

Cell free microRNAs have been shown to be remarkably stable in blood and other body fluids, as they are released into the extracellular space included in micro vesicles or exosomes or bound to high-density lipoproteins or to the Argonaute2 protein complex \\[[@pone.0201069.ref001]\\]. Recently, numerous studies have reported the potential use of circulating microRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in a wide variety of diseases such as cancers \\[[@pone.0201069.ref002],[@pone.0201069.ref003]\\], diabetes \\[[@pone.0201069.ref004]\\], autoimmunity \\[[@pone.0201069.ref005]\\] and cardiovascular diseases \\[[@pone.0201069.ref006]\\]. However, preanalytical and analytical conditions are major sources of variation in and between microRNA studies \\[[@pone.0201069.ref007]--[@pone.0201069.ref011]\\], and only a minority of the reported results have been reproduced in other studies. There are many reasons for this but, specifically, our work, and that of others, has shown that the preanalytical centrifugation conditions have a large impact on the measured plasma/serum levels of many microRNAs \\[[@pone.0201069.ref007],[@pone.0201069.ref010],[@pone.0201069.ref012]\\].

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nThe co-evolution of genes encoding interacting molecules is a subject of intense study \\[[@CR1]--[@CR4]\\] because of the intriguing question of the modes of mutation and selection that act on two molecules simultaneously. In particular, the co-evolution of the binding motif has been well investigated \\[[@CR5]\\]. These studies of co-evolution focused for example on the fitness \\[[@CR6], [@CR7]\\], on the conservation of the interaction \\[[@CR8]--[@CR10]\\], or on the evolution of the residues at the interface of the molecules \\[[@CR11]--[@CR13]\\]. While these studies on the coevolution of binding partners often require the integration of different disciplines (chemistry, evolution, biology), the establishment of the interaction from a phylogenetic point of view is less studied. Little is known for example about the origin and evolution of the different partners prior to their first interaction. Do the receptor and the ligand co-exist independently before they start to interact? Does the emergence of one partner favor the emergence of the second partner? If so, which tends to come first, the receptor or the ligand? The creation of new genetic material often relies on segmental duplication, or sometimes but more rarely on entire genome duplication \\[[@CR14]--[@CR17]\\]. Once a gene is born, either de novo"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nCD16^+^ human monocytes have gained much research interest due to their apparent expansion in various inflammatory diseases ([@B1]). These CD16^+^ monocytes consists of CD14^high^ and CD14^low^ populations ([@B2]), which expand independently of each other in different disease settings ([@B3]). Hence in 2010, the CD16^+^ subset is officially sub-divided into two subsets, intermediate (ITM; CD14^high^/CD16^+^) and non-classical (NC; CD14^low^/CD16^+^) ([@B4]), while the CD16^\u2212^ monocytes form the classical (CL) subset. However, difficulties lie in distinguishing the ITM and NC subsets as CD14 is expressed in a continuum, and the flow cytometry plot profile for CD16 vs. CD14 varies between individuals ([@B5]). These led to a proposal for the \"trapezoid\" rather than \"rectangular\" gating strategy to discriminate between the ITM and NC subsets ([@B6], [@B7]). This subjective nature of gating leads to variation when identifying subsets ([@B5]), and potential discrepancies in experimental conclusions. To improve subset identification and purity, the use of additional gating steps with more markers such as CCR2, CD36, HLA-DR, and CD11c was suggested ([@B8]). The use of SLAN to distinguish ITM from NC monocytes was also proposed ([@B9]). However, these two methods still rely on the use of CD16 and CD14 in the initial steps of"

Given the high availability of nutrients in both of these environments, early investigators postulated that fatty acids required for the generation of progeny parasites might be scavenged entirely from the host.\n\nIndeed, biochemical studies on blood-stage *Plasmodium* malarial parasites first demonstrated the parasite\\'s proficiency at scavenging and modifying lipids obtained from the host \\[[@bib-001]\\]. Free fatty acids can be obtained directly from the serum or from sources such as high-density lipoprotein \\[[@bib-002]-[@bib-005]\\]. Within the parasite, scavenged phospholipids can be incorporated without modification \\[[@bib-003],[@bib-004]\\]. Additionally, *Plasmodium* parasites can modify fatty acids as needed by elongating or desaturating the lipids and incorporating them into phospholipids, di-acylglycerols and tri-acylglycerols \\[[@bib-006],[@bib-007]\\]. The minimal lipid requirement of blood-stage *Plasmodium* parasites was determined to be a combination of palmitic acid and oleic or steric acid, which could fully replace the need for serum in culture \\[[@bib-006],[@bib-008]\\].\n\nSuch biochemical analysis has not been possible for liver-stage parasites because of the difficulty in isolating"
"See related research by Thiel *et al.*, <http://ccforum.com/content/13/4/R111>\n\nIn this issue of *Critical Care*, Thiel and colleagues \\[[@B1]\\] present a new method for tracking the changes in cardiac output in response to passive leg raising (PLR), one of the tests recently proposed to predict volume responsiveness in critically ill patients \\[[@B2]\\]. Recent review articles have emphasised the relevance of using dynamic indices such as pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation for that purpose \\[[@B3]-[@B5]\\]. Nevertheless, the respiratory variation of stroke volume cannot be used in cases of spontaneous breathing \\[[@B6],[@B7]\\] or low tidal volume ventilation \\[[@B8]\\].

The potential risks of fluid infusion are thus expected to be minimised, which is important to consider in critically ill patients in whom multiple challenges are often necessary.

"I. General Introduction {#s1}\n=======================\n\nThe digestive tract is the entry site into the body for orally administered test articles. An irritant test article may lead to local acute lesions at this first site of contact to the body and the digestive tract has been identified as the organ most commonly affected in British patients admitted to hospital with adverse drug reactions ([@Pirmohamed_et_al._2004]).\n\nOn the other hand, orally administered test articles may be highly toxic to other organs yet having little or no noticeable effect on the digestive tract.\n\nA distinctive feature of the digestive tract is the high proliferative rate of the epithelium, making it particularly sensitive to agents interfering with cell division, but resulting also in a high regenerative capacity. The villi enhance the surface of the intestine to 400--500\u00a0m\u00b2 in humans. Because of the large surface area of these tissues, accurate assessment of potential treatment effects is almost entirely dependent on a thorough gross examination and sampling of focal lesions.\n\nStandardized nomenclature and diagnostic criteria are essential to harmonize the classification and reporting of non-proliferative as well as proliferative histopathological lesions.

"Introduction\n============\n\n*Aspergillus fumigatus* is the most important pathogenic filamentous fungus in humans causing a spectrum of diseases including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and invasive aspergillosis. Among the growing population of patients with depressed immune defenses, *A. fumigatus* represents one of the major infectious cause of death. Other important pathogenic *Aspergillus* spp. include *A. flavus*, *A. niger*, *A. terreus, A. versicolor*, *A. calidoustus*, and *A. nidulans* ([@B64]). These designations actually represent sections (or complexes) of closely related species (also referred as cryptic species) that cannot be clearly distinguished morphologically. While *A. fumigatus sensu stricto* represents by far the leading human pathogen, some other species belonging to the *A. fumigatus sensu latu* complex (i.e., section *Fumigati*) have been recognized as occasional causes of invasive aspergillosis in 3 to 6% of cases ([@B13]; [@B2], [@B1]; [@B24]; **Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"}**). Their actual prevalence may be underestimated because of their lack of recognition by conventional diagnostic approaches. Moreover, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis often relies on suggestive radiological findings and/or positive fungal biomarkers (galactomannan, beta-1,3-[D]{.smallcaps}-glucan; [@B23]), in the absence of microbiological documentation and the actual contribution of *Aspergillus* spp. other than *A. fumigatus* in this setting is unknown.\n\n###### \n\nPrevalence of *Aspergillus* spp."

It is estimated that up to 10% of the human genome is affected by CNVs \\[[@pone.0189710.ref001]\\]. Thus, it is not surprising that CNVs contribute greatly to genetic diversity and affect the phenotypic traits of an individual \\[[@pone.0189710.ref002]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory and destructive joint disease characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (ACPA) ([@B1], [@B2]). Although there has been advances in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, there is a gap in knowledge regarding molecular and cellular mechanisms that cause RA. B cells contribute via their capacity to produce autoantibodies, proinflammatory cytokines and as antigen presenting cells. Early tolerance is altered in RA resulting in an increase in autoreactive B cells ([@B3]). The development of ACPA and rheumatoid factor autoantibodies precede disease development and expansion of ACPA and rheumatoid factor specific plasmablasts in RA patients with significant levels of somatic mutation, further indicating dysregulation in B cell maturation ([@B4]). Notably, B cell depletion with rituximab is efficacious in RA ([@B5]) and response to therapy with rituximab and abatacept ([@B6]) correlate with decreases in the level of ACPA. This highlights the need to better understand how B cells escape tolerance in RA and their role in propagating disease.\n\nThe role of IL-21 in B cell development and function has been well described.

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nHosts and parasites are engaged in an arms race where the evolution of traits associated with the interaction of both antagonists is the result of a mutually influenced trade-off between virulence and resistance. The continuous co-adaptation must therefore be a consequence of the frequency-dependent nature of the selective forces exerted by the parasites and the counter-adaptation of their hosts. The possible outcome of such a co-evolutionary arms race is that either one side reaches a definable optimum, thus preventing the other side from reaching its optimum, or that both sides may reach a mutual local optimum \\[[@CR1]\\].\n\nThe conventional assumption is that parasites, due to their shorter generation time, larger population sizes and higher reproductive outputs, are ahead in this co-evolutionary conflict and are therefore more likely to locally adapt to their hosts \\[[@CR2]--[@CR4]\\]. Numerous empirical studies have investigated local adaptation using model systems with varying levels of complexity, such as bacteria-phage systems \\[[@CR5]--[@CR8]\\], plant-pathogen associations \\[[@CR9]--[@CR11]\\], and animal-parasite interactions \\[[@CR12]--[@CR20]\\].

"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality ([@B1]). Transplantation and surgical resection are potentially curative options but only 30--40% of the patients are amenable to curative treatment at diagnosis ([@B2]). As most patients are not eligible for curative treatment they must rely on systemic and locoregional therapies. Systemic therapies, such as sorafenib, a multi-targeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, have demonstrated comparatively modest but still poor survival improvements of 2--3\u2009months in patients with advanced HCC who are not candidates for transplant or resection ([@B3]). However, the response rate on sorafenib is \\<5% and all initially responding patients eventually develop resistance ([@B3]).

Among the organisms able to reduce CO~2~, strictly anaerobic, acetogenic bacteria have gained much attraction in recent years \\[[@CR3]--[@CR5]\\] because they can use H~2~ and CO as reductant for CO~2~ reduction. The use of acetogenic bacteria to produce ethanol from syngas (H~2~, CO, CO~2~) is already realized on an industrial scale \\[[@CR6], [@CR7]\\]. The first step in acetogenic CO~2~ reduction is the reduction of CO~2~ to formic acid (Fig.\u00a0[1](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).

Under certain growth conditions, *E.\u00a0coli* Nissle 1917 produces significantly more CPS than *E.\u00a0coli* K5 (data not shown), making the organism attractive as a production strain for bioengineered heparin.\n\n*Escherichia coli* Nissle 1917 was cultured from a Mutaflor tablet (Ardeypharm, Herdecke, Germany) and plated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar medium; a single"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nEcological studies in offshore marine ecosystems are often complicated by a lack of information describing the ambient environmental conditions habitually experienced by resident populations. Natural proxies that indirectly record the environmental conditions experienced by marine organisms, such as the isotopic ratio of oxygen in biogenic carbonates (expressed as \u03b4^18^O values) are therefore particularly valuable for providing long-term ecological insights into marine environments [@pone.0108539-Morrongiello1]. The isotopic composition of oxygen in biogenic carbonates is influenced by both temperature and the isotopic composition of the ambient water [@pone.0108539-Kim1]. However, because water \u03b4^18^O signature is primarily salinity dependent, it is assumed to remain effectively constant in offshore water masses [@pone.0108539-Wright1], where the \u03b4^18^O values of organisms\\' calcified structures is gaining increasing recognition as a proxy for temperature [@pone.0108539-Morrongiello1]. Since the pioneering study of [@pone.0108539-Devereux1], the isotopic composition of oxygen in fish otoliths (\"ear-stones\") has thus been commonly applied as a proxy for seawater temperature both by ecologists (e.g. [@pone.0108539-Gao1]--[@pone.0108539-Dorval1]) and paleontologists (e.g. [@pone.0108539-Andrus1]--[@pone.0108539-West1]).\n\nOtoliths are calcified structures located within the inner ears of teleost fish [@pone.0108539-Campana1] which grow continuously from birth, forming seasonal accretion increments whose chemical composition reflects ambient water characteristics at the time of deposition, at least for some"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nLaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is one of the most common head and neck malignancies that remain as significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 650,000 new cases and 350,000 cancer deaths attributed to this condition occur every year \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\]. Treatment options in LSCC include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of surgery, radio- and chemotherapy \\[[@CR3]--[@CR7]\\]. Despite improvements in treatment, an epidemiological survey indicated that the clinical outcome for LSCC has improved little in the past 20\u00a0years \\[[@CR8]\\]. Therefore, it is of great significance to find novel and effective biomarkers for prediction of LSCC patients with poor prognosis or at high risk of early recurrence.\n\nRecently, there is increasing evidence that the host inflammatory response to cancer is associated with poor tumor-specific prognosis. Kawata et al*.* reported that lymphocyte infiltration around the tumor is associated with a better prognosis of HCC \\[[@CR9]\\], whereas neutrophil in tumor stroma is associated with a poor prognosis \\[[@CR10]\\]. Likewise, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a predictor of the patient's inflammatory status, has been shown to be an effective prognostic marker in many solid tumors \\[[@CR11]--[@CR17]\\]. Kum et al*.* showed that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio elevated in squamous cell carcinoma of larynx"
"INTRODUCTION {#sec1}\n============\n\nCategorical breakpoints of antimicrobial susceptibility tests are initially defined for reference broth microdilution or agar dilution methods by correlating microbiological and clinical outcomes with MIC data for the infecting organisms ([@B1]). According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines ([@B2]), disk diffusion breakpoints are established after MIC breakpoints have been determined by plotting a scattergram of the zone of inhibition diameters versus MIC values for isolates tested by both methods. Because of the inherent variation of these susceptibility testing methods, the correlation between MIC and zone diameter is not completely linear. Thus, the zone of inhibition diameter interpretative criteria that provide the lowest intermethod error rates (or discrepancy rates) are selected using a statistical method, the denominated error rate-bounded method ([@B1], [@B3], [@B4]). It is important to note that the discrepancy rates, i.e., very major (VM), major (Ma), and minor (Mi) error rates, are directly proportional to the percentage of isolates with MIC values in the range of plus or minus 1 doubling dilution of the breakpoints ([@B2]). Therefore, the performance of the disk diffusion test will vary according to the susceptibility of the organism collection to the antimicrobial agent being tested.\n\nMethicillin resistance in"
"Background\n==========\n\nPhylogenies reconstructed from DNA data are usually depicted as hierarchical, bifurcating trees, but such trees are inappropriate when intraspecific phylogenies are studied because recombination between taxa, the persistence of ancestral alleles and the presence of multiple descendents from single ancestors give rise to a reticulated and multifurcating pattern of relationships \\[[@B1]\\]. Networks rather than hierarchical trees are therefore more suitable for studying intraspecific relationships \\[[@B2]\\]. Two main types of network have been used: true phylogenetic networks which aim to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of a set of sequences, and within which nodes represent ancestral sequences and edges represent evolutionary events; and character-display networks which display all conflict within the dataset, nodes not necessarily representing ancestral sequences and some edges not corresponding to true events \\[[@B3]\\]. To construct a true phylogenetic network the dataset must be relatively small and reticulations must be rare, and often a number of networks must be evaluated to identify the optimal one. Character-display methods are therefore more popular, especially when combined with pruning methods that reduce the number of nodes and edges, giving a topology that approximates with a phylogenetic network.\n\nVarious character-display methods have been used to study intraspecific phylogenies, including reticulated networks"
"Introduction\n============\n\nEndothelial cells (EC) cover the internal surface of blood and lymphatic vessels, and play key roles in vessel formation and function. Regulation of endothelial cell--cell junctions is critically important in inflammation and angiogenesis, and incorrect junctional permeability is a major contributing factor to morbidity and mortality in acute lung injury and sepsis ([@bib43]; [@bib16]). EC homeostasis requires the integration of signals from sites of adhesion to the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells, as well as signals from circulating factors and mechanical stimuli. We are only starting to understand how these different types of signals influence each other and how they impact endothelial behavior and function ([@bib5]; [@bib34]). The integration, transmission, and regulation of mechanical forces at sites of adhesion is of fundamental importance, as they drive vessel development and progression of diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension ([@bib7]).\n\nIntercellular tight junctions are crucial for the formation of endothelial barriers, as they regulate paracellular diffusion. They have also been linked to angiogenesis and polarization, and their composition and integrity are affected by carcinogenesis and inflammation ([@bib1]; [@bib25]). Tight junctions are composed of different types of transmembrane proteins and a complex set of cytosolic proteins that link the junctional membrane"

The absence of the infra-renal segment of IVC seems to be the rarest anomaly^\\[[@b2-1063-1-7296-1-10-20190308],[@b3-1063-1-7296-1-10-20190308]\\]^, with KILT syndrome (kidney anomaly, IVC anomaly and leg thrombosis) also beingvery uncommon^\\[[@b1-1063-1-7296-1-10-20190308]\\]^. Frequently, these are incidental findings on imaging studies but have been reported during abdominal surgery or when difficulties arise during femoral catheterization.\n\nCASE DESCRIPTION\n================\n\nA 47-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of nausea, lumbar and lower limb pain and oedema, which had started the month before but had worsened during the previous week, to the point of rendering him unable to walk.\n\nThe patient reported no trauma, recent surgery, acute illness, recent immobilization, long-range flights or known triggers of his symptoms. His history included prostatitis at age 34 and elective cholecystectomy at age 37. He reported no medication, alcohol, tobacco or recreational drug use. However, he did mention that his sister and her son have had DVT, that his nephew had been diagnosed with a factor V Leiden mutation, and that his family had never been formally studied.\n\nOn physical examination, he appeared"
"Data is available on figshare with the DOI [10.6084/m9.figshare.3843372](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3843372).\n\nIntroduction {#sec001}\n============\n\nDiffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can be used *in vivo* to assess properties and potential abnormalities of tissue microstructure. A variety of parameters can be estimated by measuring the diffusion of water, exploiting the fact that the diffusion is influenced by tissue microstructure. A variety of models are used to model water diffusion. Widely used--perhaps even the default model- is the single compartment diffusion tensor model \\[[@pone.0167884.ref001]\\], with fractional anisotropy (FA) as its most commonly used parameter. This straightforward marker has been studied in the context of brain development and aging \\[[@pone.0167884.ref002]\\], and has been found to be reduced in numerous neurological and neurodegenerative diseases \\[[@pone.0167884.ref003],[@pone.0167884.ref004]\\]. Reductions in FA have been linked to axonal degeneration (e.g., in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS \\[[@pone.0167884.ref005]\\]), to myelin breakdown (e.g., in multiple sclerosis, MS \\[[@pone.0167884.ref006]\\]), or to a general state of decreased white matter integrity. Although FA is a sensitive measure, it is inherently non-specific \\[[@pone.0167884.ref007]\\]. A reduction in FA could be caused by reduced neurite density, increased dispersion of orientation, and several other factors. Related markers derived from the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor are radial (perpendicular, d~\u22a5~) and axial (parallel, d~\\|\\|~) diffusivity"
"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nMost medical schools in the world have recently begun to emphasize competency-based curricula to train highly skilled primary care physicians. The clinical practice examination (CPX) is being used as a means of assessing and training clinical competency. CPX brings several benefits in improving competent primary care physicians. Teachers are able to assess clinical skills of reasoning and communication while students demonstrate their ability to apply both practical knowledge and skills in an authentic clinical setting.[@B1]\n\nIn Korea, both the CPX using standardized patients, and the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was implemented in the Korean Medical Licensing Examination (KMLE), henceforth assessing the clinical competence of applicants as primary care physicians. It is ideal for students in clinical clerkship to enhance their clinical competence by having a good number of opportunities to experience direct interviews with actual patients. Practically, however, medical schools in Korea would find it difficult to provide an adequate number of opportunities of balanced clinical training with real patients on major clinical presentations because the number of actual patients that students may encounter is limited and the patients are not standardized. This lack of opportunity is then further exacerbated since protecting patients\\' rights is an essential"
"Guanosine is an endogenous guanine nucleoside to which has been attributed several neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. This review will describe the extracellular role of guanosine as an intercellular messenger in the Central Nervous System (CNS). We also introduce a brief historical overview of the purinergic system, centering in the guanine-based purinergic system.\n\nPurinergic system\n=================\n\nPurines are a class of aromatic organic molecules essential for all cells that include adenine- and guanine-derivatives nitrogenous bases, as nucleotides with one or more phosphates (AMP, ADP, ATP and GMP, GDP, GTP, respectively) and related metabolites such as adenosine, inosine, adenine, hypoxanthine and guanosine, guanine, xanthine and uric acid.\n\nIntracellular purines are primarily identified as structural constituents of nucleic acids, but they are also part of the structure of some coenzymes, and display roles as second messengers. Adenine-based nucleotides are well known for their fundamental intracellular role in the maintenance of energetic metabolism in the cells \\[[@b1-ad-7-5-657]\\].\n\nThe adenine-based purines effects in different cell types have unfolded the role of purines in cell signaling. Important biological functions of adenosine were initially unraveled by Drury & Szent-Giorgy \\[[@b2-ad-7-5-657]\\], demonstrating that adenosine is released to the extracellular space after heart ischemia, promoting a negative chronotropic effect"
"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nA valuable medicinal plant, *Calendula officinalis* L. (*Asteraceae*), commonly known as calendula or pot marigold, is an annual aromatic herb with yellow or golden-orange flowers. This species is widely used in pharmaceutical industry, medicine, food and cosmetology^[@CR1],[@CR2]^. The chemical composition of *C*. *officinalis* is well-determined. The flowers, leaves and stems contain flavonoids, xanthophylls, carotenoids, essential oils, coumarins (scopoletin) and water-soluble polysaccharides^[@CR3],[@CR4]^. The raw material contains triterpenoid saponins 2--10% (oleanolic acid glycosides), triterpene alcohols (\u03c8-taraxasterol, taraxasterol, faradiol, arnidiol, heliantriol) and steroids. The seeds are rich in fatty acids (about 20%) including calendic acid (about 60%). It was shown that conjugated fatty acids are active substances for the treatment of obesity and also they can protect against cancer^[@CR5]--[@CR7]^. The flowers of *C*. *officinalis* contain rutin which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic activity^[@CR1],[@CR8]^.\n\nAt the same time, polymorphism in active chemical compounds of the raw material was observed in *C*. *officinalis*, and also unstable active ingredients, e.g., carotinoids, were revealed^[@CR9]^.

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nFollowing the publication of numerous studies which demonstrated sub-optimal reproductive ability of obese women, the consequences of the obesity on in vitro fertilization (IVF) have been in the focus of the contemporary infertility research. Overweight and obese women experience a lower probability for pregnancy after IVF \\[[@CR1]\\]. Body mass index (BMI) is inversely related to intrafollicular human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations, embryo quality and IVF outcome \\[[@CR2]\\]. Despite the increasing prevalence of obesity, obese women make up a lesser proportion of women who obtain fertility-related services and the large majority of infertile women are still in the non-obese BMI range \\[[@CR3]\\]. Against this background, it would be important to evaluate the influence of BMI on IVF outcome among the non-obese women.\n\nTherewithal, thought-provoking relationship has been established between BMI and the endometriosis, the latter being one of the most common causes of infertility. Endometriosis demonstrated an inverse correlation with BMI as infertile obese women were at lower risk for development of endometriosis \\[[@CR4]\\]. Furthermore, it has been shown that lower BMI could be considered as a predictive factor not only for any type of endometriosis but also for severe ones \\[[@CR5]\\].

"Background\n==========\n\nIn a clinical trial, 1120 HIV-infected individuals initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) in rural Uganda. One hundred and five subjects died during the study. Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"} shows the number of patients dying per 100 person-years of follow up in every period post ART initiation. Inspection of the mortality rates in Table [1](#T1){ref-type=\"table\"} suggests that the risk of mortality (hazard) immediately after ART initiation is higher than the hazard in later periods. The possibility that there is a point in time that the hazard of death changes abruptly, from an early high level to a lower level, has broad implications for the management of these patients. A number of reports have indicated that mortality risk is higher immediately following the start of therapy \\[[@B1]-[@B3]\\]. These reports consider that the period of high mortality lasts about three to six months after start of therapy. To analyze this type of survival data, acknowledgement of the possibility of a sharp decline in the hazard of death is essential both for the analysis itself, and in a data-driven manner, for the probable location of the changepoint of mortality risk. In the problem discussed here, it is useful to derive objective data-driven estimates of the"
"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nEmergencies in dental hospitals can be broadly divided into medical and dental emergencies. Life-threatening medical emergencies usually occur during the dental treatment of patients with systemic diseases \\[[@B1]\\], while dental emergencies are associated with the dental procedures that involve trauma, pain, and bleeding. Therefore, analyzing the characteristics that cause an emergency in patients helps better resolve their chief complaint by changing the treatment.\n\nDepending on their timing and nature, dental emergencies can be divided into those that occur during the dental treatment, those that occur after the treatment, and those that are independent of the treatment. Most of the emergencies during the dental treatment are medical emergencies such as syncope, while emergencies after the treatment are associated with postoperative pain and bleeding having a clear cause. Emergencies independent of the treatment are mainly associated with traumas, such as dental, periodontal tissue, and jawbone traumas, and with acute dental pain including acute pulpitis and acute periodontitis caused by not receiving dental treatment in addition to the trauma \\[[@B2]\\]. When an emergency occurs in the morning or afternoon, patients can visit the nearest private dental clinic for outpatient treatment, but it is difficult to find dental emergency rooms in Korea"
"INTRODUCTION {#s1}\n============\n\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase consisting of a catalytic subunit (\u03b1) and two regulatory subunits (\u03b2 and \u03b3) and is expressed in a number of tissues, including liver and skeletal muscle \\[[@R1]\\]. The \u03b1-subunit of AMPK contains a conserved threonine residue (Thr172) by which phosphorylation by upstream protein kinases results in AMPK activation. Kinases that can activate AMPK include liver kinase B1 (LKB1), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKK) \\[[@R2]\\] and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-activated kinase (TAK1) \\[[@R3]\\]. Individuals with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome that have germline mutations in LKB1 have a higher prevalence of cancer \\[[@R2]\\]. AMPK can also be activated by extracellular changes, such as, depletion of ATP, low glucose, and changes of NADPH levels \\[[@R4]\\]. Administration of drugs and certain naturally occurring compounds can also activate AMPK. Metformin and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can activate AMPK \\[[@R5], [@R6]\\]. Polyphenols (resveratrol) \\[[@R7]-[@R9]\\], Flavonoids (quercetin) \\[[@R10]\\], and Chinese herbal compounds (berberine) \\[[@R11]-[@R13]\\] have also been shown to activate AMPK. AMPK activation by NSAID\\'s and other anti-inflammatory agents has implicated a potential role of AMPK during inflammation.

"Introduction\n============\n\nMitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play critical roles in regulating various cellular processes in eukaryotes ([@bib17]; [@bib7]; [@bib33]). They are located downstream of receptors and sensors and control cell physiology in response to various intra- and extracellular stimuli. The highly conserved MAPK cascades are composed of three kinases: MAPKs are phosphorylated by MAPK kinases (MAPKKs) at the threonine and tyrosine residues located in the activation loop (T-loop) between subdomains VII and VIII of the kinase catalytic domain; these MAPKKs are activated by the triple kinases, MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs). Activated (phosphorylated) MAPKs can directly phosphorylate certain downstream targets, which include mainly transcription factors which, in turn, initiate stimulus-induced transcriptional changes, enzymes, and even proteins that function in cytokinesis ([@bib7]; [@bib31]; [@bib42]; [@bib4]).\n\nAlthough the functions of MAPK cascades have been intensively studied in animals and yeast, how MAPK signalling is involved in plant development and stress responses is still not well understood. In plants, MAPK signalling pathways are important for development ([@bib5]; [@bib32]; [@bib54]; [@bib39]), responses to abiotic stresses, such as drought and salt ([@bib25]; [@bib28]; [@bib6]; [@bib59]), and resistance to viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens (reviewed in [@bib37]; [@bib39]).\n\nEmerging evidence has also indicated the involvement"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nAntibody-based therapies targeting T cell checkpoint receptors, CTLA-4 and PD-1, have ushered in a revitalized era of cancer immunotherapy (IMT). \u03b1-PD-1 mediated immune checkpoint blockade is now first line therapy for melanoma and PD-L1+ lung cancer, and second line therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCC-HN), and other tumor types \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\]. However, response rates vary across tumor types, and even within the most responsive cancer, namely melanoma, durable responses occur in only a minority of patients and 25% of responding patients eventually relapse \\[[@CR1], [@CR2]\\]. Importantly, \u03b1-PD-1 therapy can paradoxically accelerate tumor growth in certain patients by mechanisms that are presently unclear \\[[@CR3]--[@CR5]\\]. Many efforts are therefore underway to increase \u03b1-PD-1 response rates, identify mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired \u03b1-PD-1 drug resistance, predict potential responders or super-progressors prior to treatment, and investigate new combinatorial drug regimens.\n\nA major correlate of clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade is the quantitative load of somatic non-synonymous single nucleotide mutations (NS-SNMs) \\[[@CR6]\\].

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nCoronaviruses have been studied for more than 50\u00a0years and have infected many species of animals, which include birds and humans, and its first reported strain was isolated from the prototype murine coronavirus strain JHM \\[[@CR1]\\]. The increasing population, frequent mixing of animals, deforestation, and urbanization have increased the population of other viruses too along with coronavirus. Coronaviruses belong to the largest group of viruses which are positive-sense RNA viruses, have spike-like projections on the surface, and contain a large unusual genome which has a unique self-replication phenomenon with high rate of mutation and recombination. Because of these special characteristics, this virus needs to cross the species barrier and find new hosts to survive and replicate. In 2005, Susan and Sonia \\[[@CR2]\\] reported an avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as the examples of animal viruses which are of great importance in veterinary research methodology.

The enclosure of the genetic information within the nucleus generates a unique environment that separates DNA replication, transcription, and RNA processing from protein synthesis (for reviews see [@bib58]; [@bib23]). Communication between the nucleus and the cytoplasm occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), specialized protein-filled \"holes\" that span the NE. The NE of eukaryotes consists of a double lipid bilayer named the inner and outer nuclear membranes. The outer nuclear membrane is structurally and functionally continuous with the ER, whereas the inner nuclear membrane harbors a unique set of proteins that helps connect the membrane to the underlying lamina and provide specialized chromatin regulatory domains ([@bib57]; for reviews see [@bib33]; [@bib20]; [@bib42]; [@bib22]; [@bib56]). The inner nuclear membrane is anchored to the nuclear lamina, a polymeric meshwork composed of specialized intermediate filament proteins named lamins.

Fixed-combination therapy is the use of two or more medications that are combined in fixed concentrations into one bottle. Studies have found that fewer bottles and daily drops lead to improved compliance \\[[@pone.0229682.ref001], [@pone.0229682.ref002]\\]. Fixed-combination therapy also eliminates potential washout effects. Currently, there are several combination agents available for the treatment of glaucoma such as fixed combinations of pilocarpine/timolol, brinzolamide/timolol, dorzolamide/timolol (DTFC), brimonidine/timolol (BTFC), brimonidine/brinzolamide, bimatoprost/timolol(BiTFC), travoprost/timolol (TTFC), tafluprost/timolol (TaTFC), or latanoprost/timolol (LTFC). Most of these agents combine timolol with other hypo-tension medications. Timolol maleate is a non-selective beta-blocker that lowers IOP by reducing the production of fluid; however, it has little activity during night-time hours because aqueous fluid production by the ciliary body is reduced due to natural circadian factors \\[[@pone.0229682.ref003]\\]. The prostaglandin analogues work by allowing more fluid to flow out of the eye through the uveoscleral pathway and are therefore less affected by circadian variations in aqueous production.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nGenetic variation among and within populations arises from many factors such as mutation, migration, bottlenecks and admixture, and carries the signatures of random drift and natural selection. The complex interplay of these forces may give rise to the formation of populations which are genetically sub-structured. Uncovering such population sub-structures can give insight into the history and evolution of populations. Furthermore, identifying population sub-structures and assigning individuals to sub-populations is potentially useful in association studies, where sub-structures have to be accounted for to reduce spurious associations [@pone.0048375-Serre1] and provide useful information for conservation of genetic resources [@pone.0048375-Bowden1]. Rapid innovations in high-throughput sequencing and array technologies have led to the identification of large numbers of SNPs and to the development of SNP chips in a number of species [@pone.0048375-Pushkarev1], [@pone.0048375-Schuster1], [@pone.0048375-Bentley1]. These developments are providing new biological insights into complex population structures [@pone.0048375-Gompert1]. There is also growing interest to detect population sub-structures in \"unrelated\" samples in humans [@pone.0048375-Shriver1], [@pone.0048375-Stoneking1], [@pone.0048375-Rasmussen1], livestock [@pone.0048375-Decker1], [@pone.0048375-Gautier1], [@pone.0048375-Kijas1], dogs [@pone.0048375-Vonholdt1] and other biological populations (e.g. plants [@pone.0048375-Cortes1]).

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nWith increasing scientific evidence of the health benefits of ginseng (*Panax ginseng* Meyer), widely used in traditional medicine in Asia, its global market is growing. Ginseng's health benefits are associated with many compounds including polyacetylenes, polysaccharides, sesquiterpenes, peptidoglycans, nitrogen-containing compounds, phenolic compounds, and vitamins [@B001], but its therapeutic effects have primarily been associated with more than 30 triterpenoid saponins, also known as ginsenosides [@B002]. However, the profiles of these compounds vary by ginseng type (fresh, white, and red) and cultivation environment. Red ginseng (RG), which is steamed and dried without peeling unlike white ginseng, which is dried after peeling, is the center of attention in functional health foods because many pharmacological and biological effects of RG suggest it is more beneficial than other types of ginseng. However, there is limited information on the health benefits of RG [@B003]-[@B006].\n\nTo understand the functional properties of foods including RG, comprehensive investigations of their health effects using high-throughput analyses such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics will be necessary. In particular, metabolomics, a newly emerging technology for comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of small metabolites in organs or biofluids [@B007], is suitable to distinguish phenotypes and find the metabolites contributing to the"
"The transition to aquatic life resulted in several modifications to the auditory anatomy of cetaceans. Cetaceans lack external pinnae, and the external auditory canal has been reduced to a very narrow channel. The middle and inner ear migrated laterally out from the skull and are encased in the dense tympanoperiotic complex ([@b12]; [@b10]; [@b13]). Other characteristics of the auditory system are specific to each suborder. The gross auditory anatomy and hearing pathways in Odontoceti (toothed whales) have been relatively well described. In odontocetes, the external auditory canal is considered vestigial ([@b36]; [@b9]; [@b31]; [@b26]). Bone conduction is thought to play a minor role because there is no osseous connection between the tympanoperiotic complex and the rest of the skull in most odontocete species (Claudius, 1858, in [@b41]; [@b14]; [@b32]). In addition, the air spaces around the tympanoperiotic complex are thought to provide acoustic insulation from the rest of the skull, which may be important for directional hearing ([@b36]).\n\nA more likely mechanism for sound reception in odontocetes is via perimandibular \"acoustic\" fat bodies that are in direct contact with the ears, including both the tympanic and periotic bones ([@b30]; [@b15], [@b18]; [@b37]; [@b6]).

"Protocol\n========\n\nThe concept of a pangenome, the collection of all genes shared by multiple strains of a species, was first introduced by [@msz284-B16] and has been selectively applied to investigate genomic variability at the species level in a few tens of species (both prokaryotes and eukaryotes) ([@msz284-B18]; [@msz284-B9]). Since then, the applicability of the pangenome concept has grown alongside the exponential increase in sequenced genomes for subspecies lineages (e.g., strains, isolates, subspecies). The power of knowing the pangenome of a species resides in (i) guiding sequencing efforts to identify new unexplored genetic diversity within a species (represented by an open pangenome), (ii) providing information on shared and unique traits of strains within a species (exemplified by core and accessory genes), and, more recently, (iii) using it to identify species boundaries (represented by a high frequency of core genes).\n\nThese large-scale applications of a pangenome necessitate a fast and accurate software that can analyze and produce results for tens or hundreds of lineages in a reasonable amount of computational time. One such software is Roary ([@msz284-B13]), a Linux-native software that takes as inputs GFF3 (General Feature Formats version 3) files (easily obtainable from NCBI) and outputs a series of files"

Recent reviews have reported that 10--50% of individuals with persistent pain meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD, while 21--80% of PTSD samples report the presence of comorbid pain (Otis, Pincus, & Keane, [@CIT0041]; Villano et al., [@CIT0054]). PTSD symptoms may develop following trauma exposure and comprise re-experiencing the trauma through unwanted thoughts, memories, and reactions; avoidance of trauma reminders, psychological numbing, and symptoms of hyperarousal (American Psychiatric Association, [@CIT0002]). Persistent pain is often defined as pain that is ongoing for at least 3--6 months (Merskey & Bogduk, [@CIT0035]).\n\nVariations in prevalence rates may be influenced by differences in sampled populations, assessment methods, and criteria used to define PTSD and pain (Otis et al., [@CIT0042]). Nevertheless, it has been consistently shown that the severity of acute PTSD symptoms predict later pain severity (Drottning, Staff, Levin, & Malt, [@CIT0014]; Jenewein, Moergeli et al., [@CIT0024]) and that acute pain predicts subsequent PTSD severity and diagnosis (Norman, Stein, Dimsdale, & Hoyt, [@CIT0037]; Schnyder, Wittmann, Friedrich-Perez, Hepp, & Moergeli, [@CIT0045]).

"1.. Introduction \u00a0 {#sec1}\n==================\n\nModern condensed matter physics is increasingly concerned with phenomena that require an absence of inversion symmetry, either locally (local atomic environment) or globally (crystal point group). For example, multiferroic materials often exhibit magnetic structures that are either driven by the underlying low symmetry of the crystal structure, or lead to a spontaneous symmetry breaking, often giving rise to strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, in relating the spin structures to the underlying atomic ordering, the latter must be characterized with equal confidence. One type of structure of interest is represented by polar systems and ferroelectrics.\n\nAmong the crystal classes lacking inversion symmetry, those possessing at least a direction whose two senses are geometrically or physically different (polar direction) are called piezoelectric; among those, pyroelectric crystal classes possess a polar direction which has no symmetrically equivalent directions, and are therefore capable of sustaining a permanent electric dipole moment. Such systems are energetically degenerate (in the absence of external fields) with their spatially inverted counterparts, leading to the possibility of multi-domain states. Ferroelectrics are a subset of pyroelectric crystals whose defining property is the ability to switch the sense of spontaneous polarization upon application of an electric field of magnitude"

A shock wave, the fastest mechanical loading that can be applied to a material, provides a nearly instantaneous change in thermodynamic conditions from which material-based dynamics controlling transitions between state or physical properties, can be measured. At the macroscopic level, Dolan *et al*.[@b4] demonstrated the complexity and time dependence of a material phase transition by measuring changes in the index of refraction via optical imaging of shock-compressed water. However, obtaining atomistic data in the non-equilibrium state during the process of a material phase transition has remained elusive until now.\n\nTo understand the fundamental physics that govern atomic interactions, measurements are required at the relevant timescale and length scale. X-ray diffraction (XRD) has been used for over a century to study the atomic structure and more recently the structural changes associated with the application of pressure and temperature.

"Background\n==========\n\nSystematic reviews, technology assessments, and clinical practice guidelines all incorporate evidence-based conclusions. The multifaceted nature of evidence, however, leads to varying degrees of confidence in how well the evidence supports conclusions drawn from it. For example, one is more confident in conclusions drawn from several well-designed randomized controlled trials that find similar effects than in conclusions drawn from a few poorly designed trials with disparate results. Consequently, methods for describing one\\'s confidence in the available evidence are useful for end-users of evidence-based documents. This confidence is embodied in strength-of-evidence ratings.\n\nIn this article, we introduce a structured and transparent system for rating the strength of a body of evidence pertaining to a medical technology (see Note 1). We also define the concept of the *stability*of evidence as distinct from the *strength*of evidence. We identify the many judgments inherent in the process of performing evidence reviews, and then note how such judgments are incorporated within two prominent rating systems: the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) system and the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system \\[[@B1]-[@B5]\\]. Next, we describe our system, and detail several of its unique attributes. We present graphical illustrations of how our system"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nTraditional semen analysis measures sperm concentration, motility, morphology, and semen volume, and is acknowledged to be a poor predictor of fertility, demonstrating remarkable intra- and inter-individual variability [@pone.0020280-Leushuis1], [@pone.0020280-Swan1]. Because of these limitations, effort has been devoted to developing sperm molecular biomarkers that may better and more stably reflect sperm function.\n\nDNA methylation is the stable, covalent addition of a methyl group to cytosine that can represent response to environmental cues or exposures that may modify gene expression. Both human and animal studies indicate that abnormal sperm DNA methylation patterns are associated with subfertility, including aberrant methylation of both imprinted [@pone.0020280-Hammoud1]--[@pone.0020280-Boissonnas1] and non-imprinted genes [@pone.0020280-Houshdaran1], [@pone.0020280-Wu1], [@pone.0020280-NavarroCosta1] in oligospermic men.\n\nIn addition to DNA methylation, significant effort is being devoted to developing human sperm mRNAs as biomarkers of infertility [@pone.0020280-Krawetz1]--[@pone.0020280-Bonaparte1].

"1. Introduction {#S1}\n===============\n\nConformational changes of enzymes are often related to regulating and creating an optimal environment for efficient chemical catalysis. The dynamics and conformational changes in enzymes may range from the fluctuation of side chains to large-scale protein motions. The former helps adjusting the environment for chemical reactions and the latter enables the protein to create a tertiary structure for substrate binding. The internal motions of proteins may serve as a \"gate\" in some systems, such as HIV-1 protease, which controls ligand--protein association \\[[@R1]\\]. In many enzymes or enzyme complexes, protein motions involve allosteric communication to coordinate the function and reactions, which may be intrinsic to many enzymes \\[[@R2],[@R3]\\]. Residues in the active site directly involved in chemical catalysis may even change allosteric networks in different states during catalysis; example states are a ligand-free resting state and a substrate-bound working state.\n\nIn addition to conformational rearrangements of protein side-chains and substrates, protonation states of substrates and key catalytically important residues play critical roles in chemical reactions. For \u03b2-Ketoacyl ACP synthase I (KasA), the enzyme that involved in fatty acid synthesis, changes in protonation states on key catalytic residues at different steps are essential in enzyme activity \\[[@R4],[@R5]\\].

Although Beijing family strains were assumed to be the predominant strains causing active TB in China, different sublineages of non-Beijing strains have been detected in the countries and regions adjacent to Mainland China ([@B2][@B3][@B5]). Thus, non-Beijing strains may also contribute to the high TB burden in Asia.\n\n*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* KT-0204 is a member of the non-Beijing family MTB according to spoligotyping, and was found to be susceptible to first-line anti-TB drugs. *M.\u00a0tuberculosis* KT-0204 was isolated from the sputum of a retreatment TB patient at Masan National Hospital (MNH) in South Korea. *M.\u00a0tuberculosis* KT-0204 was grown in 7H9 broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) for 1\u00a0month at 37\u00b0C, and the genomic DNA was isolated.\n\nA paired-end sequencing library was constructed with a 500-bp insert size using the NexTera sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for the Illumina-MiSeq platform.

Due to the widespread availability of ultrasound, it seems necessary to define standards for equipment requirements, the scope of ultrasound and the experience of the person performing the procedure. The goal of this paper is to standardize the testing protocol in all neurosonology laboratories. We hope that the presented standards will prove useful in everyday patient management as well as will become the basis for discussion and comments to be taken into account in subsequent versions. The paper further describes different types of neurosonological tests, such as cerebral circulatory arrest or diagnostics of right-to-left shunts.\n\nThe proposed diagnostic criteria should be standardized in all neurosonology laboratories due to differences between ultrasonographic devices, particularly in relation to velocity calibration.\n\nAn assessment of the competence of the circle of Willis (The Matas Test) {#S0002}\n========================================================================\n\nThe Matas test is performed in situations when it is necessary to determine the competence of the circle of Willis, e.g. in the case of necessary ligation of the internal carotid artery due to the presence of a large cavernous segment aneurysm.\n\nEquipment requirements {#S20003}\n----------------------"
"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nThe DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system is important to maintain genomic stability. Mismatch repair protein MutS recognizes misincorporated nucleotides, and this starts a cascade of events involving the recruitment of several proteins. This eventually results in the removal of the mismatch and resynthesis of the new DNA strand ([@gkt582-B1]). Loss of MutS leads to a mutator phenotype in bacteria, and in humans mutations in MutS homologs can result in hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, also known as Lynch syndrome ([@gkt582-B2],[@gkt582-B3]). To understand the molecular impact of such mutations, the bacterial mismatch repair system is a widely used model.\n\nIn bacterial mismatch repair, MutS binds DNA in a homodimeric form. Within this dimer, there is an asymmetric association of the monomers when bound to heteroduplex DNA, as has been shown in crystal structures ([@gkt582-B4; @gkt582-B5; @gkt582-B6]). After mismatch recognition, MutS exchanges adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and undergoes a conformational change that allows sliding on DNA ([@gkt582-B7]).\n\nEach subunit of MutS consists of 853 amino acids in *Escherichia coli*. The currently known crystal structures of MutS bound to mismatches, however, lack a 53 amino acids long C-terminal domain. The structure of this domain has partly been elucidated fused"

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nNeoplastic transformation is the first step of the carcinogenic process that involves the initial altered responses of the cells to normal regulatory influences and sets the stage for further alterations that result in carcinoma. A wide variety of altered phenotypes appear as a result of transformation. Hallmarks of epithelial transformation and carcinogenesis include loss of polarity, as well as uncontrolled, serum-independent and anchorage-independent proliferation and resistance to apoptosis [@pone.0003529-Hanahan1]. Other fundamental hallmarks of epithelial carcinogenesis include an elevated intracellular pH (pHi) as well as their increased rate of glucose utilization over oxidative phosphorylation [@pone.0003529-Harguindey1], [@pone.0003529-Fang1]. However, our understanding of the sequence of early events mediating the initiation, development and regulation of malignant transformation is still incomplete.\n\nOne major group of cellular signal transduction components implicated in carcinogenesis are the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).

"An increased level of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) predisposes to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke. Currently, the main agents for lowering LDL levels are statins. They reduce the regulatory pool of intracellular cholesterol by competitively inhibiting HMGCoAR, the rate-limiting enzyme of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis. This in turn activates the LDL receptor (LDLR) transcription, a process under the control of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2)[@b1][@b2]. The statin cholesterol-lowering action has been consistently shown to translate into fewer cardiovascular events[@b3][@b4][@b5]. Nevertheless, residual risk persists in a large portion of statin-treated individuals, owing to either inability to achieve desirable LDL levels[@b6][@b7] or presence of other traits predisposing to CVD[@b8][@b9]. Moreover, intolerance to statins produces numerous side effects, such as myopathy with a spectrum of consequences ranging from myalgia to rhabdomyolysis[@b10]. For the treatment of these individuals, it is thus advisable to use alternative or adjunctive therapies. In this context, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has been recently identified as a new useful target for hypercholesterolemia treatment[@b11].\n\nThe human 22-kb gene *PCSK9* is located on the small arm of chromosome 1p32 and contains 12 exons and 11 introns[@b11].

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nSince Taekwondo was selected to be among the official events in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, its value as a new Olympic event has been recognized and it has evolved as a martial art sport, undergoing various changes ([@b15-jer-11-1-57]). Since the 2012 London Olympic Games, Taekwondo has shifted from the single-point scoring system to the differential point scoring system, increasing the possibility of quick turnaround of scores. The size of the Taekwondo arena was reduced to 10 (wide)\u00d710 m (long) from 12\u00d712 m. Passive progression of the game was improved to active progression through the application of the 10-sec rule. In addition, the sudden-death system implemented during overtimes was introduced in 2005. Henceforth, the importance of physical fitness started to emerge. In the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Brazil, a video replay system will be introduced, and electronic protective gears and headgears will be worn to achieve accurate first judgments. Other trends are expected.\n\nTherefore, the changes in the rules of the game require new skills and trainings, accompanied by adaptations and efforts by coaches and athletes. In reality, leaders are evaluated based on records and prizes achieved through athletic performances. However, many schools and teams do not"

This is especially true for biodiversity surveys and inventory research programs that seek to document, describe and discover novel kinds of microbes in the environment. In 2006, as part of the International Census of Marine Microbes\\' (ICoMM) efforts to define a strategy for conducting a global census of marine microbes, Sogin and colleagues [@pone.0006372-Sogin1] applied the use of sequencing short hypervariable regions of small-subunit rRNA gene hypervariable regions [@pone.0006372-Kysela1], [@pone.0006372-Neufeld1] to a pyrosequencing platform to directly sequence hundreds of thousands of bacterial V6 regions from environmental samples. Huber et al. [@pone.0006372-Huber1] extended this approach to archaea also targeting the V6 SSU rRNA hypervariable region. The outcome of these seminal experiments was the ability to sample populations at depths several orders of magnitude deeper than ever before. The experiments revealed a hitherto unseen breadth of rare members in the community and increased the species richness estimate to be on the order of 30,000 and 3,000 per liter of seawater for bacteria and archaea, respectively. More robust statistical methods applied to the Huber bacterial dataset [@pone.0006372-Quince1]"
"Food chemical analysis is recognized as a unique tool for the characterization of nutritional value, quality and safety of foods and feeds. It is of growing importance to have an accurate knowledge of the global chemical composition of food and in particular of the chemical entities known as molecular (bio)markers. Quantitative determination of chemical markers is needed for risk assessment both in food and in environmental research after toxicological characterization of natural and synthetic chemicals. The potential adverse effects of chemical species, i.e., their hazard, can be classified as acute, subacute, subchronic and chronic. However, in all cases, the risk management does refine the toxicological evaluation by the chemical quantitation and the toxicokinetic assessment.\n\nOn these bases, we proposed this special issue, in order to have a view on emerging analytical methodologies to perform toxicology marker determination.\n\nThe drive from the great development of methods in the industrial, pharmaceutical and environmental fields has extended the impact of chromatographic, spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques to the study of composition and contamination of foods.

"Introduction\n============\n\nAneurysms of the thoracic aorta are rare and occur with an incidence of 5.9 per 100,000 \\[[@B1]\\]. They are caused by weakening of the aortic wall from hypertension, heritable disorders like Marfan syndrome, bicuspid valve disease, and inflammatory and infectious processes. Among the systemic inflammatory diseases, thoracic aneurysms and aortitis occur in giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated granulomatous vasculitis, spondyloarthropathies, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus \\[[@B2]\\]. Rarely, a primary inflammatory process characterized by lymphoplasmacytic or giant cell infiltrate may be responsible.

Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nDetonation of radiation dispersal devices or nuclear weapons is expected to induce ionizing radiation injury (RI) or combined injury (CI) (i.e., RI in combination with trauma from blast, thermal energy exposure, wound, hemorrhage, etc.). RI induces DNA double-strand breaks*in vivo* \\[[@B1]\\] and*in vitro* \\[[@B2], [@B3]\\], activates NF-*\u03ba*B/NF-IL6/iNOS signal transduction pathways, elevates IL-6, IL-10, KC, G-CSF, and MCP-1 cytokine/chemokine concentrations in the peripheral blood, and increases systemic bacterial infection, thereby leading to cell death and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) and failure (MOF) \\[[@B1], [@B4]--[@B7]\\]. CI amplifies RI-induced acute radiation syndrome (ARS), thereby increasing mortality \\[[@B1], [@B5]--[@B7]\\].

Activation of immune response for elimination of virus-permissive cells is a crucial element of anti-viral protection. Liver macrophages (Mph) play a significant role in this process. They express the receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), as well as recognize and phagocytose pathogens to destroy them. However, in the process of virus elimination, activated by PAMPs, Mphs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induce liver inflammation to occur in the HCV-infected liver \\[[@B6-biomolecules-08-00113]\\]. Similarly, engulfment of apoptotic hepatocytes expressing non-structural HCV proteins by hepatic stellate cells (HSC) may activate liver fibrosis \\[[@B7-biomolecules-08-00113]\\].

"Plant phenolic and polyphenolic compounds have the same antioxidant activity since their structures contain many phenolic hydroxyl groups. The flavonoids are phenolic compounds and therefore prone to oxidation to quinones, which makes flavonoids capable of protecting unsaturated fatty acids in membranes as well as ascorbate against oxidation. Hence, certain brackets of their physiological oxidation--reduction potentials can be estimated ([@CIT0001]).\n\nQuercetin is also a flavonoid and often present as its glycoside, quercetin-3-*O-*rutinoside (rutin), in the human diet. After being ingested, rutin undergoes hydrolysis by the microflora in the colon before absorption ([@CIT0002]). The microflora in the colon has enormous catalytic and hydrolytic potential. They will first cut down the glycogen of rutin to utilize as their carbon source ([@CIT0003]) and can further catalyze the breakdown of the C6--C3--C6 flavonoid skeleton to a variety of phenolic acid catabolites ([@CIT0002], [@CIT0004], [@CIT0005]). Thus, the bioactivity of polyphenol is very much dependent on its catabolism and catabolites that occur before absorption and disposition in target tissues and cells.\n\nThe antioxidant activity of quercetin or rutin and its metabolites has also been reported in many literatures ([@CIT0003], [@CIT0006]--[@CIT0008]).

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nThe development of pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) is a frequent complication of moderate-severe and severe acute pancreatitis as well as an occasional feature of chronic pancreatitis. In most cases, PFCs will remain asymptomatic or will resolve on their own over time, and so intervention is frequently unnecessary. However, persistently symptomatic PFCs, and particularly those that become infected, will require drainage and possible debridement. The treatment of PFCs has evolved considerably over the past decade, moving from what was once open surgical management to increasingly minimally invasive techniques, both by surgery and by endoscopy. High rates of complications (64%--95%) and mortality (15%--40%) with surgical treatment of PFCs has spurred the increasing adoption of endoscopic techniques for PFC drainage and debridement \\[[@b1-ce-2017-045]\\]. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have confirmed that an endoscopic approach is safer and associated with lower costs, shorter hospital stay and improved quality of life compared to surgery \\[[@b2-ce-2017-045]\\].

The current management of diabetes aims to lower the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level to decrease the risk of diabetes complications. However, the HbA1c level varies considerably even in individuals who have similar preceding mean blood glucose (MBG) levels. Between-person biological variations in HbA1c have been studied in healthy individuals without diabetes \\[[@pone.0171753.ref002]--[@pone.0171753.ref004]\\], and it has been suggested that between-patient differences in HbA1c are greater than within-subject variations in HbA1c, and that there is a tendency for some individuals to have persistently higher or lower HbA1c levels than expected \\[[@pone.0171753.ref003]\\]. Several investigators have also identified this phenomenon in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes using the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) \\[[@pone.0171753.ref005], [@pone.0171753.ref006]\\]. The HGI is calculated as the difference between an individual's observed HbA1c and estimated HbA1c (HGI = observed HbA1c - estimated HbA1c).

"Receiving a diagnosis of diabetes has significant physical, emotional, and financial consequences ([@B1]). The development of precise diagnostic criteria is critical both to avoid the unnecessary burden of treatment in individuals who do not have the disease and to promptly identify individuals who are at risk for developing complications from diabetes so they can be appropriately counseled on disease management.\n\nTraditionally, the diagnosis of diabetes was based on glucose levels associated with the progression to overt, symptomatic disease. In 1997, the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus refocused the basis of the diagnosis to the relationship between glucose levels and the presence of long-term complications ([@B2]). This recommendation was based on the available epidemiological literature demonstrating the association between various glucose measures and microvascular complications of diabetes---particularly retinopathy, which tends to have a stronger correlation to glycemia ([@B2]--[@B4]). These studies were mainly cross-sectional, although one study did examine microvascular complications longitudinally ([@B4]). Most recently, an international expert committee and the American Diabetes Association further specified that diabetes should be diagnosed if hemoglobin A~1c~ is \u22656.5% ([@B5],[@B6]). This was based in part on additional studies showing a stronger association between retinopathy and hemoglobin A~1c~ than between retinopathy"

Researchers in moral psychology have suggested that the degree to which humans' moral decisions are based on situational factors should be clarified ([@B6]), but human moral decisions-making is complicated.\n\nWhen decisions involve a conflict in moral values, on what do individuals base their decisions? According to deontological moral theory, individuals must do the right thing at all times at all costs ([@B39]), but real moral decisions are malleable in nature, as they are influenced by external situational factors ([@B5]). Neuroimaging studies on moral dilemmas integrate the discourse about \"neuroeconomic\" models of utility to explain how situational contexts account for adaptive decision-making ([@B53]; [@B62]). For example, moral resolution may be prone to framing ([@B40]; [@B38]), magnitude and probability outcomes ([@B62]), and temporal discounting ([@B7]).\n\nIntertemporal choice theory in decision-making research refers to how people measure the costs and benefits of a decision at different times before making the final decision ([@B46]), resulting in differing utility weights for the event around the decision ([@B67]). A fundamental finding of intertemporal choice research is the gain-loss asymmetry phenomenon, where people tend to prefer immediate gains over losses"

"Good reading ability is crucial in modern literate society. It has a fundamental role in how we acquire knowledge and has been associated with employment level and socioeconomic status (e.g., [@c51]). Reading is also a cultural activity that many enjoy. There are vast individual differences in reading ability, partly attributable to cognitive skills such as verbal IQ and phoneme awareness (e.g., [@c101]; [@c102]). In addition, research suggests that reading motivation is related to the development of reading, above and beyond the effects of cognitive abilities ([@c39]; [@c69]).\n\nReading motivation refers to beliefs, attitudes, and values individuals hold specific to reading activities ([@c52]; [@c68]). Two aspects of motivation that have received much attention are reading enjoyment and reading self-perceived ability. Reading enjoyment indicates pleasure gained from a reading activity ([@c68]). Children may enjoy reading for many different reasons, including curiosity and eagerness for intellectual development and positive feedback on their reading skills. Enjoyment of reading is associated with frequent reading activities, intense concentration during reading, and better reading performance ([@c2]; [@c13]; [@c71]).\n\nReading self-perceived abilities---individuals' perceptions of their reading competence ([@c68])---are also positively associated with objectively measured reading performance ([@c2]; [@c16]; [@c17]; [@c39]).

"Introduction\n============\n\nHerbivores can dramatically influence primary production through top--down regulation in global ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. Seagrasses are well-adapted to cope with grazing pressure ([@B41]); however, plant--herbivore interactions can modify characteristics such as biomass, productivity, and species diversity. There are 31 tropical seagrass species, approximately half of the global total, grazed by a broad suite of herbivores ([@B16]; [@B83]). This diversity leads to complex interactions among plants and herbivores. In the tropics, how these interactions shape seagrass meadow properties is not fully understood ([@B93]). Such grazer-mediated changes in meadow structure can also influence the ecosystem services provided by seagrass, an area that has received little research focus ([@B9]).\n\nThe Millennium Ecosystem Assessment outlined four categories of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ([@B62]). These categories have been refined to better reflect how humans use ecosystems and to distinguish between intermediate ecosystem services, final ecosystem services, and benefits ([@B53]). This new classification prevents double-counting of services in management or economic valuations ([@B12]; [@B32]).

The identification of the underlying molecular genetics opens the possibility for understanding the genetic architecture of clinically defined categories of diabetes, new biological insights, new clinical insights, and new clinical applications.

"Aims {#Sec1}\n====\n\nCardiac dysfunction is reported after severe perinatal asphyxia. We hypothesized that maternal propofol anaesthesia during emergency caesarean section diminished cardiac injury in preterm fetuses exposed to global severe asphyxia in utero in comparison to isoflurane anesthesia. We tested if propofol decreased the activity of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 by activating the anti-apoptotic AKT kinase family and the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3).\n\nMethods {#Sec2}\n=======\n\n44 late-preterm lambs underwent standardized umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) or sham-treatment in utero.

Due to the absence of specific symptoms or signs and lack of reliable screening modalities in early disease, ovarian cancer is mostly diagnosed at an advanced stage [@pone.0069336-Bast1]--[@pone.0069336-Kobayashi1]. Currently, the standard upfront treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer consists of maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with platinum-taxane combination regimen. Although response rates are about 70--80%, the majority of these patients will eventually relapse.

Genetic factors can lead to 60--80% of AD risk ([@B28]). The *APOE* gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD ([@B7]). Several existing AD genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with relatively small effect size ([@B22]; [@B29]). The combined effect of these SNPs could make a significant contribution to AD risk. The polygenic risk score (PRS) was described to depict quantitatively the combined effect of SNPs on disease risk ([@B24]). It has been reported that PRS based on disease-related SNPs was associated with disease risk and can work as a predictor of disease risk ([@B12]; [@B33]; [@B11]). In addition, several authors investigated the effect of PRS on both disease status and disease-associated phenotypes (also called endo-phenotype) ([@B20]; [@B34]; [@B4]).

Retinal thickness has come to be recognized as a remarkably valuable measure in the management of patients with uveitic macular edema (UME) and is almost universally used as a main outcome measure in clinical trials evaluating treatments in uveitis. Qualitative data provided by SD-OCT, i.e., the presence of subretinal fluid, distribution of cysts, and ellipsoid zone status, have also been considered in some papers where the analysis of these data has contributed to understanding the pathogenesis and prognosis of UME \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\].\n\nIn recent years, hyperreflective foci (HRF) have been described in SD-OCT imaging of patients with macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy \\[[@CR4]\\], retinal vein occlusions \\[[@CR5]\\], type 2 macular telangiectasia \\[[@CR6]\\], and age-related macular degeneration \\[[@CR7]\\].

"When did you first get interested in science? {#s0001}\n=============================================\n\nFrom an early age already, my parents had instilled in me the love for nature and wildlife. On weekends, we went on nature walks and explored the nearby mountain area. Later on, I decided to study biology and learn more about the natural habitat of wild flora and fauna. One of the most unforgettable experiences during my studies was an excursion to Kenya. We climbed up Mount Kenya up to 4500\u00a0m and explored the different vegetation zones with severe changes in temperature from day to night. This made me really curious about the underlying molecular mechanisms how plants can survive these temperature changes. From that point on I was interested in the molecular basis of life.\n\nWhen did you decide to become a scientist? {#s0002}\n==========================================\n\nDuring my studies in biology with the major in plant biology and genetics, I decided to attend a two months internship in a field that was completely new to me so to open my mind to a different area of specialization.

"Introduction\n============\n\nUntil the 1950s, opium was the primary pharmacologic treatment for melancholia ([@bib33]). However, following the introduction of monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, the clinical use of opioids for depression was largely abandoned owing to their inherent risks of abuse and addiction. Today, a variety of monoamine-based pharmacotherapies for depression are available, but the incidence of treatment-resistant depression remains stubbornly high, and new clinical approaches in this setting are greatly needed. The present work reassessed the potential utility of a more calibrated opioid modulation therapy in major depressive disorder (MDD), based on advancements in, and improved understanding of, opioid biology and therapeutics.\n\nThere is an evidence to indicate that endogenous opioids have important roles in human mood and that endogenous *\u03bc-* and *\u03ba*-opioid tone is dysregulated in the context of depression ([@bib17]; [@bib19]). Opioid receptors are densely distributed in cortical regions implicated in the response to stressors, as well as the regulation and/or integration of emotionally significant stimuli, including the rostral anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortex ([@bib17]; [@bib8]; [@bib18]; [@bib30]). The opioid system has a prominent sub-cortical regulatory role in the striatopallidal pathway (nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum) and associated circuits (amygdala, thalamus, insular cortex), which are also"
"Summary\n=======\n\nWe observed significantly different curve shapes in healed chronic myocardial infarction when compared with normal myocardium and found that gadolinium kinetics was more accurately modeled (greater R2) with a 3C model rather than a 2C model. 2C Modeling of fibrotic and normal myocardium showed both a significant difference between the transport into the tissue and extracellular volumes while 3C modeling showed only a significant difference between the extracellular volumes of fibrotic and normal myocardium as well as the functional existence of a third compartment in fibrotic and not in normal myocardium.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nThere is increased interest in the quantitative assessment of myocardial gadolinium enhancement. There are a number of preclinical and clinical studies that have show the utility of MR derived variables for the assessment of dense as well as diffuse myocardial fibrosis. These studies use blood and myocardial T1 measurements followed by calculations of blood-tissue partition coefficients and tissue fractional volumes (gadolinium volume of distribution (Vd) and extracellular volume (Ve)). The typical assumption is that two-compartmental myocardial tissue modeling is sufficient. This assumes that the gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) freely passes into and out of and freely distributes within both normal and diseased myocardial tissue."

The latter is a widely-known taxon with long history of use as a food source, for example as dih\u00e9 in Africa or tecuitlatl in Mexico^[@CR1]--[@CR3]^. Presently, the members of this genus are still used as food, but a substantial part of *Arthrospira* production is sold in a form of food supplements or food additives^[@CR4],[@CR5]^; furthermore, under the commercial name of *Spirulina*, it is the most widely-produced microalgae in large-scale production^[@CR6]^.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nIn nanoscale conductors that have channel lengths comparable to the mean free path of carriers, transport approaches the ballistic limit. A ballistic model should also describe the transport properties of well-designed MOSFETs with channel lengths approaching or below the mean scattering length \u03bb. On the other hand, there is a marked difference between the current-voltage (*I*~*D*~\u2009\u2212\u2009*V*~*D*~) characteristics from a purely ballistic model, such as the one proposed by Natori^[@CR1]^, and experimental data. Although complex models can fit experimental data more precisely^[@CR2]^, the simplicity of a fewer-parameter model based on a ballistic transport formalism is desirable.\n\nIn Natori's model for ballistic transistors, MOSFET current-voltage (*I*~*D*~\u2009\u2212\u2009*V*~*D*~) relations were derived based on Landauer's formula for current through a ballistic conductor. In this work, we extend this transport model by including two physically meaningful parameters to predict device data accurately. They are transmission probability *T* and drain-channel coupling parameter *\u0394*. *\u0394* captures the effects of the longitudinal electric field in the channel and represents the fraction of the drain Fermi level that appears on the source end.

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nAlzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is one leading cause of dementia and affects more than 35 million people in the world (Gregori et al., [@B20]; Hamilton et al., [@B21]). AD is a kind of neurodegenerative disorder and mainly characterized by extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The high incidence and financial global burden of AD manifestations greatly reduce the quality of elderly life. However, the etiology of AD is complex and medicine therapy is still the mainstay for AD patients. Cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyl-adamantane) are often used for the conventional therapy of AD patients (Ahn et al., [@B1]; Dysken et al., [@B14]; Evans et al., [@B15]). However, all the medicine has significant side effects. Cholinesterase inhibitors cause the side effects, such as bradycardia (Leikin et al., [@B32]), hypotension (van Beek et al., [@B54]), and low intraocular pressure (Sawada et al., [@B52]). Memantine causes common adverse effects, such as confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia and hallucinations, and some less common adverse effects including vomiting, anxiety, hypertonia, cystitis and libido (Rossom et al., [@B50]; Jain et al., [@B25]). Furthermore, it can induce reversible neurological impairment in sclerosis (an inflammatory disease in the brain and spinal cord) patients, resulting in"
"Introduction\n============\n\nThe field of regenerative medicine in the central nervous system is currently developing in two broad directions: biological methods that attempt to repair neural pathways damaged by stroke or spinal cord injury using induced pluripotent stem, embryonic stem, or neural stem cells; and brain-machine interface technology, such as cochlear implants, using microprocessor technology. Cochlear implants convert sound to electrical signals, which are used to directly stimulate the cochlear nerve, thus bypassing the patient's cochlear deficiency. Cochlear implants have already demonstrated excellent outcomes, with hearing improving in nearly 80% of patients; many patients have also gained the ability to communicate via the telephone.\n\nAuditory brainstem implant (ABI) is an extension of the principle of cochlear implants. Cochlear implant replaces the function of the inner ear (cochlea) to stimulate the cochlear nerve (primary neurons). In contrast, ABI involves direct stimulation of the secondary neurons of the relay nucleus (cochlear nucleus) in the brainstem. ABI was first introduced in the United States in 1979,^[@B1],[@B2]^ and considerable improvements have since been made. Currently, ABIs have been provided to more than 700 individuals worldwide.

"1. Introduction {#sec1-molecules-21-00526}\n===============\n\nChrysanthemum (*Chrysanthemum morifolium*) is a commercially valuable ornamental species worldwide. Increasing urbanization and an improving standard of living is stimulating the demand for both cut flowers and pot plants in China, prompting a rise in the monoculture-based production of chrysanthemum. As for most crop species, long-term continuous monoculture-based production results in serious continuous cropping obstacles of the chrysanthemum \\[[@B1-molecules-21-00526],[@B2-molecules-21-00526]\\]. In the monoculture-based production system, chrysanthemum is generally affected by the *Fusarium* wilt, caused by *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *chrysanthemi* (*F. oxysporum*), which is considered to be the most important soil-borne facultative pathogen, causing economically important losses of chrysanthemum and limiting chrysanthemum production \\[[@B3-molecules-21-00526]\\].\n\nThe two most effective current interventions are the fungicide carbendazim (MBC) and the soil fumigant dazomet (DAZ), but neither of these compounds is considered to be environmentally friendly and their sustained use may have negative effects on soil ecosystem \\[[@B4-molecules-21-00526],[@B5-molecules-21-00526]\\].

"Introduction\n============\n\nConstipation is a common disorder with an estimated prevalence of approximately 15% in the United States ([@b12]). Women are affected more commonly than men, although the mechanism that accounts for this disparity has not been identified. Constipation is also more prevalent in the elderly, in non-Caucasians, and in patients in lower socioeconomic classes ([@b12]; [@b21]). Although the natural history of chronic constipation is not as well studied as other common functional bowel disorders such as dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), most patients with chronic constipation remain symptomatic when surveyed 18--20 months after initial evaluation ([@b30]).\n\nAlthough not a life-threatening illness, chronic constipation markedly affects patients' quality of life and imposes a significant economic burden to the health care system. Using the well-validated SF-36 questionnaire, several studies have shown that patients with chronic constipation note a reduction in quality of life across multiple domains, including both physical and psychological domains ([@b13]; [@b8]). The costs associated with treating chronic constipation arise due to both indirect and direct costs. Indirect costs include missing school or work (absenteeism) and being less productive at school or work (presenteeism), while the direct costs of treating constipation include office visits, diagnostic tests, and medications."
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nLiver ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathophysiological process in many clinical settings, such as hypovolemic shock, liver tumor resection and liver transplantation [@pone.0104043-ToledoPereyra1]. The mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of liver I/R injury include reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium overload, cytokines and cell apoptosis [@pone.0104043-Romanque1]. It was well known that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are related with pathogenesis of I/R injury, and contribute to I/R-induced injury, as they cause direct cellular injury and activate a cascade of mediators leading to microvascular changes, increased apoptosis and acute inflammatory changes with increased necrosis [@pone.0104043-Datta1] [@pone.0104043-Eguchi1]. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) plays an important role in maintaining the oxidative antioxidant balance [@pone.0104043-Lehmann1], malondiadehyde (MDA) is the product of free radical lipid peroxidation and its activity represents the capability of subsequently causing changes in a variety of cytokines [@pone.0104043-CamaraLemarroy1], the capability of glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) reductase are to scavenge free radicals in the I/R injury [@pone.0104043-Jaeschke1] [@pone.0104043-Jaeschke2] [@pone.0104043-Sasaki1].

"Sir,\n\nSurgeries are associated with blood loss which can be moderate to severe. Loss of blood in the intraoperative period is of concern to both the surgeon and the anaesthesiologist. Accurate assessment of blood loss is necessary as underestimation can lead to delayed replacement which results in hypoperfusion, decreased haemoglobin, delayed recovery, and increased morbidity and mortality.\\[[@ref1]\\] Overestimation of blood loss can lead to unnecessary transfusion, volume overload, and cardiac failure.\n\nWe present a case of a 70-year-old female patient weighing 50 kg suffering from carcinoma of the endometrium undergoing staging exploratory laparotomy. The patient was accepted under American Society of Anesthesiologists\\' physical status class-II with a haemoglobin level of 10 g/dl. Maximum allowable blood loss (MABL) calculated was 550 ml. General anaesthesia (GA) along with epidural analgesia was administered. No epidural drug was given except the test dose which was negative. Intraoperatively, the patient had an episode of hypotension as blood pressure dropped from 130/70 mmHg to 85/54 mmHg with heart rate increasing from the basal value of 78 beats/min to 118 beats/min.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nThe critical importance of volcanic arcs in the formation and evolution of the continental crust and the cycling of elements through time between the crust, mantle, and exosphere has been recognized for several decades^[@CR1]--[@CR5]^. As a result, the overarching igneous and metamorphic processes that give rise to arc magmatism have been well studied and are, for the most part, quite successful at explaining the various magmatic compositions erupted at volcanic arcs^[@CR6]--[@CR11]^.\n\nHowever, there are other important aspects of arc volcanism that are quite poorly explained by existing models. One notable example is the dramatic diversity evident in volcanic activity within the same volcanic arc. This diversity is expressed as, among other things, large variations in erupted compositions, erupted volumes, edifice numbers, eruption style, and morphology between individual volcanoes and subarc segments---and even between volcanoes that lie in close spatial association^[@CR8],[@CR12]--[@CR17]^. In the Cascades Arc, for example, erupted volumes differ by a factor of two between the southern and northern portions of the arc, and there are major changes in the partitioning of volcanism between intermediate and silicic-dominated central volcanic edifices and fields of more mafic and dispersed monogenetic centers (Fig.\u00a0[1](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}).

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nCytosine DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is conserved across all kingdoms of eukaryotes. Depending on its location in the genome, DNA methylation can be broadly classified as either genic or non-genic. Genic---or gene-body---methylation has been observed in several species of plants and animals, and generally correlates with transcriptionally active loci [@pgen.1003946-Zemach1]--[@pgen.1003946-Zhang1]. Conversely, non-genic methylation is associated with transcriptional repression at repetitive elements such as transposons [@pgen.1003946-Law1]. Both plants and animals also have examples of non-genic DNA methylation repressing protein-coding gene transcription when the mark is present in the gene\\'s regulatory regions [@pgen.1003946-Bird1], [@pgen.1003946-Chan1].\n\nIn the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*, gene-body methylation is exclusively found in the CG dinucleotide context and is maintained by METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1), the plant ortholog of mammalian DNA Methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) [@pgen.1003946-Cokus1]. In contrast, non-genic methylation is maintained by at least four methyltransferases: MET1, CHROMOMETHYLASE 2 (CMT2), CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2). The four methyltransferases have distinct cytosine contexts that they preferentially act upon: CG (MET1), CHG (CMT3) and CHH (CMT2 and DRM2), where H is any base that is not a G [@pgen.1003946-Cao1], [@pgen.1003946-Zemach2].

In close collaboration with partners from clinical, public health, industry, and regulatory sectors, CDC has developed a campaign to promote healthy contact lens wear and care practices that can help reduce the risk for eye infections and complications associated with poor contact lens hygiene.\n\nMicrobial keratitis is a serious, sometimes blinding, eye infection often associated with poor contact lens hygiene. CDC has published a report on the first estimate of the burden of keratitis, including microbial keratitis, and contact lens disorders in the United States, using data from national outpatient and emergency department databases ([@b1-1039]). The report finds that episodes of keratitis and contact lens disorders result in an estimated 930,000 outpatient visits and 58,000 emergency department visits annually that cost \\$175 million in direct health care expenditures.\n\nEstablished, modifiable risk factors for microbial keratitis, such as overnight contact lens wear, poor contact lens storage case hygiene, and infrequent storage case replacement ([@b2-1039],[@b3-1039]), indicate that this serious and costly eye infection is largely preventable. As such, patient education about healthy contact lens wear and care practices is essential and warranted. Additional information on Contact Lens Health Week and the"
"1. Introduction {#sec1}\n===============\n\nCationic polymers with a large number of primary amine groups, such as polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer, polyethylenimine (PEI), and chitosan, are widely used in development of gene delivery carriers to promote cellular uptake via electrostatic interactions between positive and negative charges on the cell membrane \\[[@B1]--[@B4]\\]. Furthermore, these polymers are thought to have a strong pH-buffering capacity that enhances proton absorption in acid organelles and osmotic pressure buildup across the organelle membrane. These processes in turn promote the endosomal escape and release of genes into the cytoplasm \\[[@B5], [@B6]\\]. Quantum dots (QDs) are useful imaging tools for cellular labeling and monitoring due to their optical properties, such as a high fluorescence intensity, remarkable resistance to photobleaching, broad absorption spectra, and narrow emission spectra \\[[@B7], [@B8]\\].

In the central nervous system (CNS), complement components have been found to play important roles in neuron survival and synaptic pruning under both normal and disease conditions ([@bib22], [@bib30], [@bib47], [@bib54]). However, the regulatory mechanisms for complement expression and function in the CNS are still largely unknown.\n\nThe *SUSD4* (Sushi domain-containing protein 4) gene resides on chromosome 1q41 and encodes a 49-kD transmembrane protein containing four extracellular Sushi domain motifs ([@bib60]). The Sushi domain, also known as the complement control protein domain, is commonly involved in protein-protein interactions. Many complement regulators are constructed with complement control protein domains ([@bib16], [@bib26]). SUSD4 functions as a complement system regulator, as it has been shown to bind to the C1 complex and complement component C1q and block the activation of the complement cascade by interrupting the formation of C3 convertase ([@bib20]). However, SUSD4 has also been reported to inhibit the alternative pathway warranting further studies to clarify the SUSD4 mechanisms of action on the complement system.\n\nIn humans, the CNS is"
"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nCerebrovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in women, accounting for about 50% of total cardiovascular deaths in the United States. Besides, about two thirds of survivors developed residual disability. Although women younger than 30 years have a stroke incidence less than 5%, the effect of stroke on long-term disability is even greater in this age group. According to the American Stroke Association, the risk for stroke is higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant young women, with the highest stroke risk occurring in the third trimester and postpartum.[@B1][@B2] The physiologic changes of pregnancy, specifically venous stasis, edema, and hypercoagulability caused by activated protein C resistance, lower levels of protein S, and increase fibrinogen, when combined, increase risk for CVD during pregnancy and the postpartum period.[@B3]\n\nPreeclampsia is a leading cause of severe maternal morbidity, mortality, and adverse perinatal outcomes, which complicates approximately 2%--8% of all pregnancies; it is characterized by dysfunctional remodeling of maternal vessels at the implantation site.[@B4] Increased placental oxidative stress by shallow invasion of trophoblasts leads to endothelial dysfunction and a systemic inflammatory response.[@B5] Many studies have reported that preeclampsia increases risks for cardiovascular disease.[@B6][@B7][@B8][@B9] Preeclampsia is also one of"

While it is certainly known that anemia can have adverse effects on patients, particularly in cardiovascular and neurocritical care patients^[@R3358]^, what is becoming more evident is that correction of anemia via blood transfusion is not beneficial to many patients, and in fact, may be more harmful, unless the patient is acutely symptomatic"

This clinical manifestation is also known as filiform polyposis, localized giant pseudopolyps, or just giant polyposis \\[[@rjx174C1]\\]. By definition the polyps are \\>1.5 cm in any dimension \\[[@rjx174C2]\\].

Although previously associated with asymptomatic or mild disease ([@B1], [@B2]), ZIKV is now emerging as causally associated with severe neurological and ophthalmological malformations in fetuses after congenital infection, as well as neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome in adults after recent ZIKV infections in French Polynesia ([@B3], [@B4]), and Brazil ([@B5], [@B6]). Due to the spread of the virus by the arthropod vector and secondary transmission through sexual contact ([@B7]), blood transfusions ([@B8]), and transplacental means ([@B9], [@B10]), the virus currently circulates in more than 80 countries and territories within Africa, Asia, and the Americas ([@B11]). In response, a strong global initiative to develop safe and effective countermeasures has engendered more than 30 preclinical vaccine candidates ([@B12]). Currently, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent disease associated with ZIKV infection; however, several ZIKV vaccine candidates have progressed to Phase 1/2 clinical trials, including DNA/mRNA, purified inactivated ZIKV, and measles virus-vectored vaccines.\n\nThe nucleic acid vaccine platform relies on the immunogenicity of the antigen generated through *de novo* synthesis in the recipient.

"Plain english summary {#Sec1}\n=====================\n\nHealth researchers often use questionnaires to collect data. When patients fill in questionnaires, they may interpret the questions differently from how the researchers intended. This is an example of response error. Answers can also be affected by how much effort it takes to fill in the questionnaire, this is called response burden. For example, patients may pay less attention at the end of a long questionnaire. Involving patients in questionnaire design is important because it can help prevent response error and burden.

Serotonin receptors are expressed throughout the immune system (Herr et al. [@CR22]; Ahern [@CR2]). 5-HT~7~ receptor is a member of the family of serotonin receptors, originally cloned in 1993 (Bard et al. [@CR7]; Lovenberg et al. [@CR37]; Ruat et al. [@CR48]) a little more than a decade after the first receptor, 5-HT~1~ receptor, was (Peroutka and Snyder [@CR41]). Like other serotonin receptors, 5-HT~7~ receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Their activation leads to the initiation of two well-characterized signaling pathways: the *canonical* signaling occurs through G\u03b1s, while a *non-canonical* pathway signals through G\u03b112 (Guseva et al. [@CR19]). Different 5-HT~7~ receptor isoforms have been described (5-HT~7a~, 5-HT~7b~, 5-HT~7d~, all expressed in humans and rats, as well as 5-HT~7c~, expressed only in rats) differing only on the carboxy terminus length, nonetheless, no relevant functional differences have been observed between them (Liu et al.

Periventricular leukomalacia is a kind of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. A recent study showed that oligodendrocytes played an important role in the occurrence, development and turnover of periventricular leukomalacia\\[[@ref12]\\]. Cytokines produced toxic effects on white matter by inhibiting the differentiation of oli-godendrocyte precursor cells, inducing glial cell apoptosis, and causing myelin sheath degeneration\\[[@ref13]\\].

However, most Canadians remain unaware of another important disparity between common and rare disease care in this country: namely, the availability of research funding. Above and beyond worrying about expensive therapies, patients diagnosed with a rare disease are often surprised to learn that there is limited scientific knowledge about the causes and natural history of their condition and little or no ongoing research.\n\nThe reasons for this research gap are many.

"INTRODUCTION {#S1}\n============\n\nRenal transplantation is the ideal method for treating patients with end-stage renal disease. While considerable advances have been made in organ transplantation and immunosuppression for renal transplantation, post-transplantation urinary tract infection (UTI) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. The importance of this concern is further underscored by the fact that UTI is the most common infection in such patients, ranging from 35 to 79% and accounting for approximately 40--50% of all infectious complications ([@R1]-[@R3]), and about 60% of bacteremia originate from UTIs ([@R2]). Nevertheless, the rates of serious post transplantation complications that are associated with UTI, such as bacterial septicemia, remain high for patients even in the modern era ([@R4]). In renal transplant recipients, UTI may lead to failure of transplantation and even death.\n\nA well urinary tract is protected against infections by a range of non-immunologic and immunologic mechanisms that are not fully efficient in renal transplant patients ([@R5]).

"Introduction\n============\n\nThere are different viruses that cause respiratory infections. Most of the time it is very difficult to know the causative agent from the respiratory symptoms. In order to identify the possibility of a virus being the causative agent of the respiratory infection and to identify the type of virus that is causing the respiratory symptoms, nasal swabs were collected from patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection.\n\nMethods\n=======\n\nDuring a 6-month period (1 February-31 July 2014) 365 nasal swabs were collected from patients with symptomatic respiratory infections admitted to Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil for polymerase chain reaction virus detection (CLART Pneumovir) capable of detecting 14 respiratory viruses.\n\nResults\n=======\n\nAlmost half of the samples collected tested positive. Specifically, 48.76 % (178/365) of samples were positive for respiratory virus. Syncycial respiratory virus accounted for 19.66 % (35/178), influenza H3N2 for 14.61 % (26/178), parainfluenza virus for 7.3 % (13/178), influenza B virus for 6.18 % (11/178), influenza H1N1 for 1.69 % (3/178) and influenza C for 1.69 % (3/178).\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nRespiratory virus is a common cause of respiratory infection requiring hospital admission, rhinovirus being the most prevalent.

"Introduction\n============\n\nClassical nearly neutral theory proposes that selection will be less efficient as the effective population size (*N*~e~) goes down ([@msv069-B47], [@msv069-B48], [@msv069-B49]). In this context, we can, for example, interpret the finding that humans have a more \"bloated\" genome than seen in a species such as yeast which has a large effective population size and a correspondingly \"lithe\" genome ([@msv069-B45]). A lithe genome is one with short intergene spacer, relatively little repetitive sequence, few introns with the few found being relatively small. Might it, however, be the case that, as genomes decay owing to reduced *N*~e~, the error rates of critical processes go up (cf. [@msv069-B21])? This might include increased mistranscription, mistranslation, missplicing, incorrect protein folding, incorrect phosphorylation, incorrect subcellular localization, etc. ([@msv069-B44]). Might this in turn then result in otherwise paradoxical stronger selection on error mitigation phenotypes when populations are small? Were this so, this would add a novel dimension to the nearly neutral hypothesis, as it would suggest that selection can sometimes be stronger when effective populations sizes are small, because, in this instance, the error rates are higher.\n\nIn the article, we examine this possibility by considering splicing error as an exemplar. In particular, we"
"Editor: David Odde.\n\nIntroduction {#sec1}\n============\n\nHow does the cell control the size of its organelles? This question has been puzzling cell biologists for decades. Cells must have a robust and efficient procedure for building organelles with a specific size and shape. The stochastic kinetics of polymerization typically leads to formation of structures with widely varying sizes in the absence of any size-dependent assembly or disassembly processes ([@bib1]). But organelles are thousands of times bigger than the materials used to build them, so how can molecular pathways of assembly sense and respond to organelle size to yield organelles of a necessary size for proper function? This problem is extremely difficult to solve in the general case considering the many different types of organelles and their often highly complex structures. To simplify the problem, we will just consider the eukaryotic flagellum. Flagella (also known as \"cilia\") are long whiplike appendages protruding from certain cells and are used for both locomotion and sensing. Unlike a prokaryotic flagellum, which is made of a tube of a single polymer, the eukaryotic flagellum is a more complex structure made of nine microtubule doublets underlying a protrusion of the plasma membrane. These doublets are nucleated by"

Typically, chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Despite the fact that the combination of fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and trastuzumab has provided HER2-positive patients with significant survival benefit \\[[@CR3]\\], prognosis for patients with AGC is still grave due to the limited treatment options and inevitable drug resistance. Therefore, exploring potential novel drugs is needed for GC.\n\nCamptothecin (CPT) is a pentacyclic quinoline alkaloid isolated from the Chinese *Camptotheca acuminata* tree. Based on the CPT structure, 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), irinotecan, topotecan, gimatecan and other analogues have been developed as broad-spectrum antitumor drugs to treat colorectal cancer \\[[@CR4]\\], lung cancer \\[[@CR5]\\], melanoma \\[[@CR6]\\], hepatic carcinoma \\[[@CR7]\\] and neuroblastoma \\[[@CR8]\\].

"Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions are at the center of cellular regulation.

The sensitive and versatile detection of macromolecular interactions without the aid of fluorescent or luminescent labels is considered one key goal of proteomics \\[[@B2]\\]. The cost and potential interference of fluorescent protein tags or coupled fluorophores with the kinetic parameters of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions have led to serious efforts to develop and optimize label-free detection of proteins. Several technologies have been developed for that purpose \\[[@B3]-[@B6]\\]. For example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) performed on gold surfaces has been the mainstay of detecting interactions between protein pairs or protein ligand binding \\[[@B7]\\].

"Toward a classification of medications for sleep and circadian rhythm disorders\n===============================================================================\n\nTo facilitate health care decisions and clinical research, physicians, scientists, patients, insurers, hospitals, and other entities find it helpful to list drugs into classification systems. Most systems are organized around therapeutic mechanisms, organ systems, diseases, and chemical characteristics. Therapeutic classification may reflect the condition for which drugs are used -- including, for example, antidepressants, antihypertensives, and antipsychotics -- or the salient chemical characteristics of a drug class (eg, benzodiazepines, thiazolidinediones). Although some drugs are classified under one drug class, as the therapeutic benefit of some drugs can extend to multiple conditions, several listings are occasionally used. Basic research frequently classifies drugs based on chemical structure or binding characteristics. For example, beta-lactams comprise a diverse group of antibiotics, all of which prevent bacterial cell wall synthesis and possess a beta-lactam ring as one element of their chemical structure.[@b1-nss-5-143] Similarly, nuclear receptors are a class of agents that bind DNA and affect the expression of genes.[@b2-nss-5-143]\n\nFor drugs used clinically, the best systems are based on clinical indications since they provide the prescriber with information about the condition for which the drug is prescribed.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nOne of the most common questions concerning sleep is: \"how much should we sleep?\" Several systematic reviews on sleep duration and mortality have found that the optimal sleep duration is 7\u00a0h, with a significant increase of overall mortality for individuals with short (\u22646\u00a0h) or long (\\>8\u00a0h) sleep \\[[@CR1]--[@CR3]\\]. In a critical review Kurina et al. \\[[@CR4]\\] argue that results from the literature are not totally consistent. The analysis of Kurina et al. \\[[@CR4]\\] included 42 studies, giving rise to 55 different estimates of the association between sleep duration and overall mortality, based on which only 14 studies (25%) showed a U-shaped relationship, while 23 studies (43%) showed no association at all, and the remainder showed associations for either short or long sleep. Their main arguments against the presence of a U-shaped relationship between sleep and mortality are the heterogeneity in the measurement of sleep duration and in its categorization, the use of different methods and variables for adjusting for potential confounders across studies, and different age ranges.\n\nSince sleep duration decreases with age \\[[@CR5]\\], age may be a confounder of particular interest.

"Population aging is both a worldwide success story and a worldwide health conundrum, with the increasing age of populations around the world leading to unprecedented challenges ([@B1]). According to the United Nations report on World Population Prospects (2017), there is an estimated 962 million people aged 60 years and above who comprise 13% of the global population ([@B2]). The beginning of the twenty-first century has seen health systems worldwide struggling to deliver quality healthcare amidst challenges posed by aging populations ([@B3]). Traditional medicine and models of care have been premised on the evaluation and treatment of standalone and usually acute diseases occurring in relatively younger individuals. This contrasts with the current reality of multiple, interacting, and often chronic conditions affecting older persons.

"Introduction\n============\n\nPosttranslational modifications of histones, including acetylation, are critical mechanisms that affect different aspects of plant growth and development ([@B36]). These modifications alter the chromatin structure, and thus have an essential role in DNA metabolism. Posttranslational modifications act consecutively or in combination in a pattern known as the \"histone code\", which induces conformational changes in chromatin, therefore affecting for example the accessibility of genes to the transcriptional machinery. In particular, histone acetyltransferases regulate the acetylation of histones and other proteins such as transcription factors, affecting chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, and DNA metabolism in general. Hyperacetylated histone lysines are associated to actively transcribed genes, while hypoacetylated histones are typically linked with transcriptionally inactive DNA ([@B29]; [@B56]; [@B49]). Acetylated lysines at the amino-terminal histone tails change histone--DNA interactions and make the DNA more accessible ([@B36]). Thus, these changes in histone acetylation/deacetylation are essential for the regulation of gene expression ([@B42]; [@B49]; [@B41]; [@B24]). On the other hand, the modification of the histones--DNA interactions by changes in histone acetylation can also alter DNA repair rates. For example, maize and Arabidopsis plants treated with an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases, curcumin, previous to a UV-B treatment show increased DNA damage ([@B11]).\n\nKey participants in"

Another hypothesis proposed by *Rao et al.*[@b8][@b9] considers warming of the Southern Indian Ocean (SIO) as the key driver for the decrease in ISMR.

"Background\n==========\n\nIdentification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is fundamental of understanding gene regulations. Binding sites or motif instances are typically 10 \\~ 15*bp* in length and degenerated in some positions.

Hence, using computational approaches to discriminate motif signals from background signals has not always brought satisfactory results. Development of advanced tools is necessary for more accurate motif predictions.\n\nAn essence of computational approaches for motif discovery is to search for motifs that are over-represented in the input sequences compared to the background sequences. Motif over-representation can be explained by the existence of segments that have been evolutionarily preserved due to their functional significance to gene regulation.

Understanding the signal transduction pathways responsible for the development and progression of fibrosis is key to prevention and cure.\n\nA critical event in fibrogenesis is activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are the primary source of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins ([@R18]; [@R27]). Quiescent HSCs control ECM turnover by releasing limited amounts of ECM molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, and their inhibitors. Liver injury activates and transforms HSCs into fibrogenic myofibroblasts that acquire the ability to produce \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and abundant ECM components, including type I collagen (COL1A1), fibronectin (FN1), and ECM remodeling enzymes such as thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP1). HSC activation represents the major source of fibrogenic myofibroblasts irrespective of the underlying cause of liver damage ([@R9]; [@R27]).\n\nTGF-\u03b2 is the master regulator of fibrosis ([@R21]; [@R23]). The canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling components include TGF-\u03b2 ligands, TGF-\u03b2 receptor 2"

Erythrocytosis is classified as relative (due to decreased plasma volume), primary (due to an intrinsic defect of the erythropoietic component in the bone marrow [@bib1]), or secondary (associated with conditions that increase erythropoietin levels) in origin. Secondary erythrocytosis can be caused by a physiological elevation due to tissue hypoxia or an abnormal overproduction of erythropoietin (i.e., patients with renal cysts, renal artery stenosis, and tumors with ectopic erythropoietin production) [@bib2]. Idiopathic erythrocytosis is diagnosed when no causes for erythrocytosis are identified. In the present report, we describe a case of an end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patient who developed idiopathic erythrocytosis after initiating hemodialysis.\n\nCase report {#s0010}\n===========\n\nA 78-year-old man presented to our hospital with erythrocytosis in November 2013. He was in a good condition while continuing to receive hemodialysis thrice weekly for 4 years, except for the presence of erythrocytosis, as per his monthly blood tests. When he first started hemodialysis, his hemoglobin level was 9.8\u00a0g/dL, and therefore, ferrous sulfate and erythropoiesis stimulating agents were prescribed.

The main role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is to suppress inflammation \\[[@B2]\\]. The generation of peripheral Tregs is particularly important in the intestinal tract, and about 20--30% of Tregs in the intestine are adaptively induced Tregs (iTregs) \\[[@B3], [@B4]\\]. Tregs express a lineage specification marker Foxp3 and they use various types of suppression mechanisms including the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and TGF-*\u03b2*) and cell-cell contact \\[[@B2], [@B5]\\]. In addition to the expression of Foxp3, a very recent study demonstrated that another Th2 type CD4 T cell lineage marker Gata-3 is critical to maintain homeostasis and suppressive function of Tregs in suppressing intestinal inflammation*in vivo* \\[[@B6], [@B7]\\].\n\nThere is a high incidence of Tregs in tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) populations \\[[@B8]\\].

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nNegative symptoms in schizophrenia are a major cause of functional deficit for patients wanting to return to professional life. While many of the approved antipsychotics can control the positive symptoms, negative symptom dysfunction is often not addressed properly by drug therapy alone (Rosenbaum et al., [@B68]). In addition, there are species differences for animal models that have large ramifications for drug development in schizophrenia (Peleg-Raibstein et al., [@B64]) and consequently psychiatric disorders have one of the lowest probabilities of clinical success, close to 7% (Hay et al., [@B29]). Because of these limitations, companies are de-emphasizing psychiatric diseases (Hyman, [@B36]), suggesting a need for completely novel technologies.\n\nNegative symptoms can be divided in two moderately correlated factors (Horan et al., [@B35]): experiential impairments (diminished motivation and enjoyment of social, vocational, and recreational activities) and expressive impairments (diminished non-verbal and verbal communication). Experiential impairments are best represented by avolition and anhedonia, while expressive impairments are related to flat affect. Both these dimensions play an important role in the clinical phenotype.\n\nGlutamate modulation through increased glycine mediated stimulation of the NMDA-R has been proposed as a strategy for addressing negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

The possibility of *C. difficile* presence in intestinal of healthy individuals and newborns are 2%--3% and 40%, respectively ([@B17]). The most frequent predisposing risk factor for *C. difficile* infection (CDI) in humans and animals is the destruction of regular intestinal microflora due to long-term antibiotic usage. CDI causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, pseudo-membranous colitis, toxic mega colon, and even deaths can be seen in some serious cases ([@B6]; [@B8]; [@B26]; [@B32]).\n\nSome *C. difficile* strains produce Toxin A (enterotoxin) and Toxin B (cytotoxin) or both which were released from *tcdA* and *tcdB* genes, and some others can have *cdtA* and *cdtB* genes which produce binary toxin. The virulence of this bacterium is mainly related to the presence of these toxins.

"Introduction\n============\n\nGlucose metabolism has been suggested to be improved under different types of hypoxic conditions. In fact, several studies have shown that under chronic hypoxia (CH) and short-term chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), glycemia and insulin levels decrease and insulin sensitivity increases in humans ([@B56]) and murine models ([@B13]; [@B9]; [@B21]). However, the changes in long-term CIH have rarely been studied. The definitions of short- and long-term CIH vary. Short-term CIH includes minutes or hours of hypoxia during a brief period, while long-term CIH includes several days of hypoxia over a longer period of time ([@B49]).\n\nHypoxia exposure induces an adaptation process to replenish ATP in the cells that generate changes in glucose metabolism ([@B57]; [@B21]). There are several mechanisms involved in glucose regulation under hypoxic conditions, with the most important role played by glucose transporters (GLUTs) ([@B13]; [@B7]; [@B39]). Cellular glucose uptake is mainly accomplished via facilitated transport mediated by a family of GLUTs: GLUT1 is responsible for basal glucose uptake, and GLUT4 is an insulin-regulated GLUT; both transporters are present in skeletal muscles ([@B48]). Insulin and energetic stress increase GLUT4 membrane translocation in skeletal muscles by different signaling mechanisms. Each stimulus, alone and in combination, results in the"

They belong to the superfamily of cys-loop receptors due to the presence of an extracellular pair of disulphide-bonded cysteines separated by a stretch of 13 amino acids [@pone.0062435-Karlin1]. Eleven nAChR subunits have been identified in mammalian neurons (\u03b12 to \u03b110 and \u03b22 to \u03b24) [@pone.0062435-Lukas1], [@pone.0062435-Corringer1]. All nAChR subunits have a similar structure with an N-terminal extracellular domain of \u223c210 amino acid residues containing the acetylcholine binding site, four transmembrane domains (TM1--TM4), a large intracellular loop of \u223c150 amino acids between TM3 and TM4, and a short extracellular C-terminal tail [@pone.0062435-Albuquerque1].

For improved recognition and diagnosis of this condition, the international restless leg syndrome study group (IRLSSG) has published the clinical diagnostic criteria for RLS \\[[@B1]\\]. The four essential criteria which must be met for the positive diagnosis include an urge to move legs accompanied by unpleasant sensation, beginning during periods of rest and inactivity, worsened in evening or at night, and partially or totally relieved by movements.

IBD is a heterogenous disease ith respect to disease location, disease course, occurrence of extra-intestinal manifestations and therapeutic response. The disease course is characterized by exacerbations and remissions. IBD is generally considered to arise from the interaction between host genetics, environmental factors, dysregulated immune responses and alterations in the intestinal microbiota composition [@pone.0090981-Scharl1]. IBD, especially active disease, is associated with a decreased quality of life and high health care costs, [@pone.0090981-Blumenstein1], [@pone.0090981-Buchanan1] especially due to the use of medication [@pone.0090981-Blumenstein1], [@pone.0090981-vanderValk1]. Treatment is mainly based on symptom reduction by nonspecific immune-modulating drugs and can be associated with serious side effects [@pone.0090981-Talley1]. Further insight in causative factors associated with the development of exacerbations (i.e. active mucosal inflammation) may contribute to new specific treatment options for IBD.\n\nThe intestinal microbiota is considered to play a central role in the pathogenesis of IBD and numerous studies have corroborated evidence for intestinal dysbiosis in IBD patients compared to healthy controls [@pone.0090981-Frank1]--[@pone.0090981-Sokol1]. The gut microbiota of healthy individuals is dominated by the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and to"
"Background\n==========\n\nAmyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques constitute a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Neuroinflammation has been hypothesized to play a pathogenic role in the development of sporadic AD, particularly because pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines colocalize with neurodegenerative pathology in both AD patient brains as well as in transgenic mouse models of AD type pathology (reviewed in \\[[@B1]\\]). However, the placement of the inflammatory response in AD neurodegenerative cascade is still debated, with conflicting ideas of innate immune activation either being the trigger, a homeostatic response mechanism or a bystander phenomenon associated with the disease pathology \\[[@B2]\\].\n\nAnti-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin (IL) -4, lead to the suppression of pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages, microglia, T cells, and astrocytes \\[[@B3]\\]. Anti-inflammatory cytokines are thought to enhance A\u03b2 degradation through phagocytosis and receptor-mediated uptake leading to the abrogation of A\u03b2 induced cell death in APP transgenic mice \\[[@B4],[@B5]\\] and primary glia \\[[@B6]\\]. Down regulation of IL-4 receptors contributes to aging related cognitive impairment \\[[@B7]\\]. Consequently, IL-4 or minocycline treatment leads to restored synaptic activity in rats following intracerebroventricular infusion of A\u03b2 \\[[@B8]\\]. However, emerging evidence has also shown that activation of the innate immune system may"
"Introduction {#cesec10}\n============\n\nUnderstanding the effectiveness and duration of protection afforded by oral cholera vaccines is needed to develop effective vaccination programmes. One meta-analysis of killed oral cholera vaccines showed an average protective efficacy of 58% and average protective effectiveness of 73%.[@bib1] Although efficacy studies suggest a decline in protection 2 years after oral vaccination[@bib1], few studies have reported long-term two dose-effectiveness, and no long-term prospective study of effectiveness has been done outside of Asia, where cholera has been endemic for centuries. The absence of studies of the duration of oral cholera vaccines protection outside the historically cholera-endemic areas of south Asia necessitates evaluating these effects in other populations where conditions of previous and ongoing exposure to *Vibrio cholerae* might differ.\n\nCholera was introduced to Haiti in 2010, and since then has become endemic. Use of killed, bivalent, whole-cell oral cholera vaccines (Shantha Biotechnics, Hyderabad, India) were first implemented as part of a comprehensive response to cholera in selected high cholera-incidence communities in rural and urban Haiti in April, 2012.[@bib2], [@bib3] It was in this context that we initially did a case-control study to evaluate the effectiveness of killed, bivalent, whole-cell oral cholera vaccines in the rural campaign catchment area"
"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nFibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling mediates diverse cellular responses during embryonic development and plays critical roles in the physiological and pathological processes of the adult organism \\[[@b1]\\]. Particularly, FGF signaling plays a crucial role in the self-renewal and proliferation of various stem cells such as human embryonic stem cells, human-induced pluripotent stem cells, trophoblast stem cells, and neural stem cells (NSCs) \\[[@b2],[@b3]\\]. Moreover, it has been recently reported that cancer stem cells derived from various types of human tissues, such as brain and breast tissues, can be cultured in vitro in the presence of FGF \\[[@b3]\\]. Many studies indicate that FGF signaling has critical functions in both self-renewal and proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in vitro and in vivo \\[[@b4]--[@b7]\\]. The molecular mechanisms by which FGF controls the two distinct processes, that is, the self-renewal and proliferation of stem cells, are still unclear. The lack of such knowledge prevents the development of appropriate methods to cultivate stem cells with suitable qualities, which are critical to regenerative medicine such as cell replacement therapy for disease-damaged tissues or organs.\n\nThe membrane-linked docking/scaffolding adaptor FGF receptor substrate 2 (FRS2)-\u03b1 acts as a central mediator for FGF signaling \\[[@b1],[@b8]\\].

"Introduction\n============\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are characterized as hazardous organic pollutants comprising two or more fused benzene rings in linear, angular and clustered arrangements, and their distribution in the environment and possible human exposure is a public concern ([@B28]; [@B16]). To minimize PAHs threat to human health, increasing interest is given to restore the contaminated sites with PAHs ([@B14]; [@B36]). Microbial decontamination of PAHs is claimed to be an efficient and economic alternative to physicochemical treatment techniques ([@B8]; [@B6]; [@B2]). Although great advances have been made in many aspects of PAHs biodegradation, there remain practical constrains in efficiently implementing bioremediation technology due to the complex nature of the contaminated sites and the lack of valuable information concerning the environment adaption and pollutant degradation performance of microbes ([@B14]; [@B7]; [@B18]; [@B2]). Therefore, to develop a bioremediation strategy it is essential to understand the genetic potential of the native microorganisms in the contaminated sites.\n\nA number of microorganisms have been isolated from various environments based on their capability to biodegrade PAHs, especially with high molecular weight (HMW) ([@B29]; [@B27]; [@B35]). Fluoranthene, a representative of HMW PAHs, has received extensive attention. Multiple bacteria capable of fluoranthene degradation have been reported, with this"
"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nPsychological stress is common in our fast-paced society and strongly influences our mental and physical well-being. Humans exposed to common aversive or stressful experiences exhibit a wide range of responses, yet the majority maintains normative psychological and physiological functioning. The ability of an individual to withstand and adapt to stress and adversity is broadly defined as *resilience* (Fletcher and Sarkar, [@B43]; Horn et al., [@B53]). The question as to why resilient individuals minimize pathophysiological outcomes when faced with stressful life events, while others succumb to stress and develop psychopathologies such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as somatic ill-health, has been addressed by scientists for decades, resulting in a fairly comprehensive description of the psychosocial factors linked to a stress resilient profile. The use of adaptive coping strategies, the individual emotion regulatory capacity, factors like optimism, and an ability to face fears, as well as a strong social support system, among others, all contribute to resilience in adulthood (Feder et al., [@B39]).\n\nDespite the growing interest in the construct, the implementation of resilience training and monitoring programs has proven difficult, mainly because of the absence of objective measurements of resilience. Presently, the assessment"
"Introduction\n============\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the second major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [@B1]. Commonly, it is a highly malignant cancer typically developing in the liver with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Theoretically, hepatocarcinogenesis depends on two major principles: (1) the activation of oncogenes (e.g., c-myc, \u03b2-catenin), growth factor (e.g., IGF-II, TGF-\u03b1) and telomerase enzyme inducing cellular immortalization and (2) the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (e.g., p53 and Rb) and decreased expression by different modifications such as promoter methylation, mutations, biallelic loss and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) [@B2]. Multiple risk factors for developing HCC including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination, alcohol abuse, ionizing radiation and metabolic products can cause DNA damage in hepatocytes [@B3]-[@B5]. Therefore, those accumulated DNA damages occurred on tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes are important genetic events of HCC oncogenesis and progression. A few inactivated tumor suppressor genes such as TP53 and activated oncogenes such as \u03b2-catenin, gp130 resulted from somatic mutations play critical roles during hepatocarcinogenesis, as demonstrated by previous investigations [@B6]-[@B8]. Recent sequencing analysis of exomes and genomes in multiple HCC cohorts has defined not only common events that target"

Among the various procedures, uterine dilatation and curettage (D and C) goes with many complications \\[[@B1], [@B2]\\]. We report this case of an intestinal infarctus through the vagina, a rare phenomenon seen for the first time in our unit since 10 years, with the aim of depicting a surgical complication of D and C.\n\nCase Report {#sec1_2}\n===========\n\nMrs NC, 34 years, G6P5015, presented for acute pelvic pain and a mass between the thighs. She had had a clandestine D and C 4 hours before after 7 weeks of amenorrhea. On entry, she had a BP of 90/50 mm Hg, a pulse of 92/min, a temperature of 37\u00b0C and pale conjunctivae. On clinical assay, there was a cold, dark intestinal mass between the thighs with no mesenteric pulsations (fig. [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). There was a globular uterus with diffuse abdominal tenderness; vaginal exam confirmed an intestinal mass. Biological exams showed anemia with hemoglobin 9.9 g/l and hemocrit of 29%. On this basis a laparotomy was done after a 6 h reanimation. We found a posterior uterine perforation 5 cm long, a hernia of the ileo-cecal junction with necrosis at the basis of"
"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nPeritoneal fibrosis is a serious complication in multiple clinical settings, including peritoneal dialysis (PD), a life-sustaining therapy used for patients with renal failure worldwide who account for approximately 10 to 15% of the dialysis population^[@CR1],\\ [@CR2]^. Long-term PD treatment can cause repetitive peritoneal injury, producing progressive fibrosis of the submesothelial region that normally consists of a thin layer of connective tissue with a few scattered fibroblasts^[@CR3]^. Peritoneal fibrosis is associated with ultrafiltration failure and loss of the dialytic capacity in the peritoneum, and can result in the development of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). EPS can cause bowel obstruction, and is associated with mortality rates as high as 38 to 56%^[@CR1],\\ [@CR4],\\ [@CR5]^. However, the precise pathogenic mechanisms driving the development of peritoneal fibrosis remain unclear.\n\nPathologically, peritoneal fibrosis is characterized by accumulation of collagen-producing fibroblasts and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix that disrupts normal peritoneal architecture and homeostasis^[@CR6],\\ [@CR7]^. Expansion of the collagen-producing fibroblast pool is a critical component of the development of peritoneal fibrosis, but the molecular mediator(s) driving this expansion remain to be fully elucidated. Long-term exposure to PD fluid also induces angiogenesis in the peritoneum, and the inhibition of angiogenesis has been reported to"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nWe previously reported that polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) had the properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs) \\[[@CR1]\\] and commonly appeared in many kinds of malignant tumor. PGCCs were once thought to be senescent cells due to their inability to undergo mitosis or cytokinesis and had no long-term survival or proliferative capacity \\[[@CR2]\\]. Cobalt chloride (CoCl~2~), a chemical hypoxia simulator, was used to induce the formation of PGCCs in vitro. When recovered from CoCl~2~ treatment, PGCCs can generate daughter cells via asymmetric cell division. Daughter cells from PGCCs have strong invasion and metastatic abilities \\[[@CR1], [@CR3]\\]. In malignant solid tumor tissue, PGCCs often appear around necrotic areas and in the boundary of infiltration between normal and tumor tissues (invasive front), where tumor cells are under hypoxic microenvironment \\[[@CR4]\\]. Our previous study has confirmed that PGCCs can be formed by cell fusion and that cell fusion-related proteins syncytin 1, CD9, and CD47 participate in PGCCs formation \\[[@CR5]\\]. Furthermore, abnormal expression of cell cycle-related proteins and changes in subcellular localization also play an important role in the formation of PGCCs \\[[@CR1], [@CR6]\\].\n\nPGCC formation is associated with abnormal expression and change in subcellular localization of CDC25C \\[[@CR6]\\].

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nLarge bone defects (LBD) derived from tumor resection surgery or congenital malformation still remains a complicated clinical condition with inadequate repairing even using conventional methods^[@CR1],[@CR2]^. Bone tissue engineering has provided a way of repairing bone defects; autograft, allograft and biomaterials have been applied to fill the defect areas to accelerate osteocyte regeneration^[@CR3]^. These repair approaches, however, still exhibit apparent limitations, such as the poor histocompatibility of biomaterials^[@CR4]^ and allograft rejection. Therefore, autologous bone graft still represents the gold standard for bone defect repair, which displays good histocompatibility with almost no immune response^[@CR5],[@CR6]^. In recent decades, instead of direct autologous bone implantation^[@CR7]^, autologous mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) implantation^[@CR8]^ and its repair capacity have attracted enormous attention for LBD reconstruction.\n\nMuscle-derived MSCs (M-MSCs)^[@CR9]^ serve as progenitors of connective tissue cells and are of great importance in adult tissues^[@CR10]^. M-MSCs exhibit general characteristics of stem cells, and can extensively self-renew and differentiate into diverse cell types, including muscle cells and osteocytes. Unlike bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs)^[@CR11]^, M-MSCs can be easily obtained from adult muscle tissues, which accounts for about one third of body weight. M-MSCs are easy to be separated from muscles and cultured *in vitro* as well. These characteristics"
"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide^[@CR1]^. Due to the dietary habits and public hygiene, higher incidence, poor prognosis and rapid progression of HCC is reported in East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, especially in China^[@CR2],\\ [@CR3]^. Chemotherapy remains as the curative option of choice, but the efficacy of remains limited by chronic hepatitis infection and inflammation^[@CR4]^. Simultaneously, the severe systemic side effects resulting from nonselective biodistribution still enormously restrict the clinical applications.\n\nIt has been found that *CD4* ^+^ *CD25* ^+^ regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid derived suppressor cells, and various immunosuppressive factors, including interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), vascular endothelial growth factor, and prostaglandin E2, are frequently enriched in the tumor microenvironment and facilitate tumor immune evasion^[@CR5]^. Antagonizing immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment are a prerequisite for the translation of antitumor immune responses into therapeutic benefits^[@CR6]^. Tregs have been shown to reduce the host antitumor responses and presence of Tregs in both the peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment has been associated with a poor patient prognosis in HCC patients^[@CR7],\\ [@CR8]^. Therefore, targeting the number and function of Tregs may be a useful and effective approach for HCC therapies."
"Background\n==========\n\nMusculoskeletal trauma has a high incidence. In The Netherlands, in 2011, 3.3 million injuries were treated medically in a total population of 16.7 million \\[[@B1]\\]. Taken per capita, this density is approximately the same in the United States. In 2006/2007, more than 61.2 million patients with musculoskeletal injuries were treated annually in the United States in a total population of 300 million \\[[@B2]\\]. Most injuries concern soft tissue, such as strains, sprains and contusions, also referred to as acute musculoskeletal syndromes \\[[@B3]\\]. Strains and sprains is a collective term for muscle and ligament injuries without dislocation or fracture. A contusion is a haemorrhage (usually in the skin) resulting from a direct trauma. These injuries are often treated in the Emergency Department or in General Practice. Pain management in the acute phase is a crucial part of treatment and can be non-pharmacological (RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) and/or pharmacological \\[[@B4],[@B5]\\]. The treating physician prescribes paracetamol (acetaminophen) or Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID's), or patients use these drugs without prescription, as they are available over the counter. It is unclear, however, whether NSAID's have any additional value for the treatment of pain in patients with an acute musculoskeletal trauma \\[[@B3]\\]. Because"
"Background\n==========\n\nTandem repeats are one of the most studied genome rearrangements \\[[@B1]-[@B3]\\]. Frequently located in genes or regulatory regions, tandem repeats (TR) play an important role in gene expression, genome evolution and transcriptional regulation \\[[@B2]-[@B5]\\]. They represent an important source of genome variation, help determine individuals inherited traits and are involved in genetically inherited diseases \\[[@B6]\\].\n\nA TR is a sequence from a genome made of several (not necessarily exact) copies of the same pattern, located next to each other. In the case where each copy is identical to the pattern, the sequence is called an *exact tandem repeat*(ETR). Otherwise, it is called an *approximate tandem repeat*(ATR). Depending on the pattern length, TR are classified into microsatellites (1-10 bp), minisatellites (10-100 bp) and satellites (*\\>*100 bp) \\[[@B7]\\].\n\nThe problem of TR detection has been the subject of many studies due to the TR important roles. The search of TR in genomes can be done in two contexts: either in the case where a reference sequence exists or in the *de novo*context (*i.e*. without a reference sequence).\n\nTR detection on reference sequences of genomes, chromosomes or other types of assembled DNA sequences can be performed by a significant number of"
"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nFever of unknown origin (FUO) was originally defined by Petersdorf and Beeson \\[[@CR1]\\] as an illness of more than 3\u2009weeks' duration, with fever greater than 38.3\u2009\u00b0C (101\u2009\u00b0F) on several occasions, the cause of which is uncertain after 1\u2009week of in-hospital investigations. To meet the evolution of diagnostic capabilities, some modifications in the definition of FUO occurred through the years: in 1991, Durak and Street proposed that there be a distinction between classical FUO and three other types, namely nosocomial, neutropenic and HIV-associated FUO; moreover, they reduced the duration of investigation, before defining a FUO, to at least 3\u2009days in hospital or at least 3 outpatient visits \\[[@CR2]\\]. In recent years, some authors \\[[@CR3]--[@CR6]\\] proposed to change the quantitative criterion (diagnosis uncertain after 1\u2009week or 3\u2009days of investigation) with the qualitative requirement that fever remained undiagnosed after a minimal diagnostic work-up had been performed; however, investigations that should be included in the work-up remain a matter of debate.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of FUO is the most wide-ranging in medicine, since more than 200 conditions have been identified as the cause of FUO \\[[@CR7]\\].

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nNeck pain is highly prevalent with a reported 1-year prevalence estimated to be 30 to 50\u00a0% in the general population \\[[@CR1]\\]. Neck pain also contributes to activity limitations in 11 to 14\u00a0% of workers \\[[@CR2]\\]. In the largest group of neck pain patients, the underlying cause of the pain is uncertain \\[[@CR3], [@CR4]\\]; hence, the designation is non-specific neck pain. The alleviation of symptoms and restoration of functional limitations are particularly important for neck pain sufferers without a clear pathophysiology. To evaluate and establish effective treatment and rehabilitation strategies, access to reliable and valid patient-reported outcome measures, i.e., standardized questionnaires measuring specific constructs of interest, is a necessity. There are a number of questionnaires available to measure pain and disability in people with neck pain. However, weaknesses in measurement properties of several questionnaires were recently recognised, and important methodological aspects to improve were, for example, content validity regarding the relevance and comprehensiveness of items and the use of better statistical methods in responsiveness studies \\[[@CR5], [@CR6]\\]. Also, Wiitavaara and co-workers \\[[@CR7]\\] found a low correspondence between neck--shoulder pain questionnaires and the symptoms experienced by the sufferers, implying a questionable content validity of the questionnaires.

"Introduction {#Sec1}\n============\n\nMany viruses infect their host through mucosal surfaces that are coated with microbial life and recent advances show a dynamic interplay between bacterial and viral species and the host^[@CR1]^. Several reports show that respiratory infections such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induce epithelial cell damage that can potentiate bacterial colonization and secondary infections^[@CR2]--[@CR5]^. The bacterial encoded lipopeptide Pam3-Cys-Ser-Lys4 was reported to enhance RSV attachment to their target cells via an undefined mechanism^[@CR6]^, highlighting a role for bacterial species to facilitate virus infection. Viral-bacterial co-infections are commonly observed in patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease^[@CR7],[@CR8]^ and in a caecal-ligation puncture model of sepsis, pulmonary murine cytomegalovirus virus infection was shown to reactivate and cause enhanced pathology^[@CR9]^. Moreover, sepsis and bacterial meningitis is associated with reactivation of multiple virus types including Varicella Zoster and Herpes Simplex virus reactivation^[@CR10],[@CR11]^ highlighting a role for polymicrobial infections to influence the development of chronic disease.\n\nViral entry into a host cell represents the first step in the infectious life cycle and is mediated via specific interactions between virus-encoded proteins and cellular receptors that define internalization pathways^[@CR12]^.

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nThe demand for endocrinology services is growing worldwide, mainly due to the rapid increase of diabetes, obesity, the metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis and is particularly notable among minority, immigrant and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations \\[[@CR1]--[@CR5]\\]. Chronic endocrine diseases may cause serious complications, including disability and death, imposing major social and economic costs on patients, their families and society at large \\[[@CR6]--[@CR8]\\]. Some other classic endocrine diseases (i.e. thyroid, adrenal, pituitary, and neuroendocrine pathology) are of lower incidence and are thus a challenge for diagnosis and proper management. This heavy and diverse burden of endocrine disease requires efficient handling of the treatment by primary and secondary physicians in the community, and, in special circumstances, the hospital, setting (Fig.\u00a0[1](#Fig1){ref-type=\"fig\"}). To accomplish this, an ongoing adaptation of the healthcare system is required. Although the greatest demand for endocrinology services is in the community, endocrinology fellowships, continuing medical endocrine education (CME) and research, collaborative consults, exposures to rare endocrine diseases, and access to acute care patient services, are almost always hospital-based. Further, with the rapid change in the perception of current endocrinology towards patient-centered individualized treatment plans, including thyroid and neuro-endocrine oncology, the scene of a single physician managing the patient's"
"All surgical procedures result in some degree of tissue trauma and associated pain. Over the last two decades in veterinary medicine, there has been a dramatic shift in the approach to perioperative pain, with an increased recognition of pain and increased use of analgesics to control perioperative pain (Lascelles & Capner [1999](#vms343-bib-0023){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Hunt *et\u00a0al*. [2015](#vms343-bib-0018){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Most would agree that as veterinary surgeons, it is our ethical obligation to minimize pain and suffering in animals, and it is recognized that pain delays healing and return to function and can result in chronic postoperative pain. In humans, interest in chronic pain after surgery has dramatically increased since the finding that more than 20% of 5000 of patients attending chronic pain clinics cited surgery as the cause for their chronic pain (Crombie *et\u00a0al*. [1998](#vms343-bib-0007){ref-type=\"ref\"}) and it appears that even common minor procedures such as hernia repair have a significant risk of chronic pain. Unmanaged acute pain can lead to chronic, maladaptive pain through the process of neuroplasticity, or remodelling of pain pathways (Reddi & Curran [2014](#vms343-bib-0030){ref-type=\"ref\"}). Chronic, maladaptive pain is very difficult to manage, whereas post\u2010surgical pain is generally considered easier to manage (Grichnik & Ferrante [1991](#vms343-bib-0015){ref-type=\"ref\"}; Woolf [2010](#vms343-bib-0042){ref-type=\"ref\"}).\n\nIn the"
"Introduction {#S1}\n============\n\nThe molecular machinery mediating neurotransmitter release is strongly conserved throughout evolution: Ca^2+^ triggers exocytosis of neurotransmitter from synaptic vesicles (SVs) in less than a millisecond by binding to Synaptotagmin, which together with Complexins activates a core fusion machinery composed of SNAREs and SV proteins ([@B61]). These events are confined to specialized sites of the presynaptic plasma membrane, called active zones, by a network of proteins including RIMs, RIM binding proteins, Munc13s, \u03b1-liprins and CAST/ERC proteins. One of the ways by which these scaffolding molecules act is that RIMs recruit both calcium channels and Munc13s, which make SVs tethered at the active zone fusion competent ([@B60]; [@B25]; [@B1]). The physical and functional interactions of all these proteins represent an evolutionarily conserved machinery mediating regulated neurotransmitter release at active zones. The evolutionarily conserved Ca^2+^ binding proteins Calmodulin and Synaptotagmin-7 further refine the machinery by regulating presynaptic plasticity such as short-term depression and short-term enhancement to transmitter release ([@B29]; [@B27]).\n\nPiccolo/Aczonin and Bassoon are particularly large active zone scaffolding molecules, consisting of approximately 5000 and 4000 amino acids, respectively ([@B15]; [@B62]; [@B74]).

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nSickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic haematological disorder caused by mutations in the sixth amino acid to be substituted from glutamic acid to valine and characterized mainly by vaso-occlusion and anaemia \\[[@CR1]\\]. Nowadays several researches investigate metabolic syndrome (MetS) development among SCD patients \\[[@CR2]\\]. Little is known, however, about the prevalence of metabolic syndrome determinants among adults with SCD \\[[@CR2]\\]. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that are associated with a two-fold increase in cardiovascular disease outcomes and a 1.5-fold increase in mortality \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\]. To diagnose the metabolic syndrome, patients must achieve three out of five factors: increased waist circumference, triglyceride levels, blood pressure and fasting blood glucose levels, and decreased HDL levels \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\].\n\nWaist circumference was found to be lower in patients with SCD, although waist to hip ratio is greater than their matched control; which is most probably due to recurrent avascular necrosis of head of the femur that causes a decrease in hip circumference \\[[@CR4]\\].

"INTRODUCTION {#SEC1}\n============\n\nDuring the last decade, bioinformatics analyses have predicted that many key proteins involved in cell signaling and regulation are disordered or contain large disordered regions under physiological conditions ([@B1],[@B2]). These Intrinsically Disordered Proteins or Regions (IDPs/IDRs) are more abundant in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes, thereby suggesting a correlation between disorder and the complexity of biological processes. The discovery of biological functions for non-globular proteins required a reformulation of the traditional structure/function paradigm ([@B3]).\n\nThe amino acid sequences and the structural features of IDPs have evolved to execute specialized functions that complement those performed by their globular counterparts ([@B4]). The biological function of many IDPs is manifested when they recognize their biological folded partners. This recognition frequently involves linear motifs of the disordered chain. Upon binding, these motifs adopt relatively fixed conformations adapted to the structural and chemical signatures of the partner, while the rest of the IDP remains flexible in the context of the complex ([@B5],[@B6]). The reduction of the conformational fluctuations of recognition elements upon interaction with the partner implies an entropic cost that often leads to low to intermediate affinity complexes. This entropic modulation of the interaction is a key contributor to achieving tunable responses"
"Human \u03b3\u03b4 cells bearing the V\u03b39 (TCRGV2S1)/ V\u03b42(TCRDV102S1) TCR react to a variety of phosphorylated nonpeptidic ligands ([@B1]--[@B4]), some of which are natural metabolites ([@B5]). The TCR participates in the stimulation of the cells by such ligands as evidenced by reconstitution of reactivity when V\u03b39 and V\u03b42, but not other V\u03b3 or V\u03b4 genes, are co-transfected into a nonresponder T cell line ([@B6]). \u03b3\u03b4 T cell recognition of phosphorylated nonpeptidic ligands has two remarkable characteristics ([@B5]): (*a*) it is highly specific, since minor modifications in the structure of the ligand abolish recognition, and (*b*) all V\u03b39/V\u03b42 cells ex vivo and clones show the same specificity since they are broadly cross-reactive against different metabolites, and all ligands display the same relative potency on all tested T cell clones and polyclonal lines. Without exception, we observe that in vitro cultivated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells progressively lose their capacity to proliferate in response to the weaker ligands first, and to the stronger ones later on, while maintaining their ability to react to mitogens and to express similar levels of TCR (monitored by flow cytometry analysis using antibodies against CD3\u03b5, C\u03b4, V\u03b39, and V\u03b42, data not shown).

"Introduction {#s1}\n============\n\nThe initial and final positions of moving objects are often mislocalized. The initial position of a moving element is displaced in the direction of the motion, known as the Fr\u00f6hlich effect [@pone.0053815-Frhlich1], [@pone.0053815-Kirschfeld1]. In a similar vein, a target flash is mislocalized toward a trailing task-irrelevant flash [@pone.0053815-MacKay1]. Moreover, not only the initial position but also the final position of a moving element is displaced in the direction of the motion [@pone.0053815-Freyd1]--[@pone.0053815-Kerzel1].\n\nWe were interested in whether non-retinotopic motion processing also took part in the mislocalization of the initial and final positions of moving objects. Previous studies using the Ternus display have suggested that motion correspondence between visual elements can be determined retinotopically or non-retinotopically depending on the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between frames [@pone.0053815-Ternus1]. When a temporal interval between two successive frames of visual elements is short (\\<30 ms), motion correspondence is retinotopically determined ([Figure 1A](#pone-0053815-g001){ref-type=\"fig\"}), and this results in an element motion percept [@pone.0053815-Pantle1], [@pone.0053815-Petersik1].

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nMyopia is a prevalent cause of vision impairment, although the cause and exacerbating factors are not completely understood. Histological analysis has revealed choroidal thinning in myopia, reported to be between 11 and 13\u00a0\u00b5m of thickness lost for each decade of life, and 6--9\u00a0\u00b5m lost with each dioptre of myopia \\[[@CR1]\\]. Moreover, progressive choroidal thinning has been found to be age-related in normal eyes as well \\[[@CR2]\\]. Despite abundant epidemiological evidence, the root cause or determinant of choroidal thinning in myopic eyes remains poorly understood. Some histopathological studies have suggested that choroidal thinning in myopia may be associated with a loss of large blood vessels \\[[@CR3]\\], while others have postulated that this may result from pronounced thinning of the choriocapillaris \\[[@CR4]\\].\n\nEnhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is an acquisition technique that places OCT images near the zero-delay line, so the roll-off of sensitivity does not compromise image registration.

Although first-line treatments for B-precursor ALL have improved survival rates, a considerable proportion of patients are refractory to treatment or experience relapse \\[[@CR2]--[@CR5]\\]. Adults with relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL have a very poor prognosis; the main aim of treatment is to achieve a durable remission without compromising health-related quality of life (HRQL) \\[[@CR2]--[@CR5]\\]. However, the HRQL of adults with relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL, including the impact of their treatment, is not well understood. This is likely due to the rarity of the disease.\n\nIn many countries, the decision to approve novel therapies is informed by calculation of the cost per quality adjusted life-year, which requires utility data to quantitatively compare health states alongside survival \\[[@CR6], [@CR7]\\]. Generally, HTA agencies prefer utility data derived directly from patients in a clinical trial, using the EQ-5D \\[[@CR6]--[@CR8]\\].

"Environmental temperature is a primary variable important for biological function at all organizational scales. Even slight temperature changes can dramatically affect biological processes from cells to populations, with strong ecological consequences. At the smallest scale, temperature drives cellular reaction rates through kinetic processes. Individuals respond directly to environmental temperature---for example, by modulating their activity rates (Payne et al. [@bib67], Payne 2018). Population demographic rates are also temperature sensitive (Dell et al. [@bib17]), with consequences for abundance and occupancy patterns. Demographic changes in combination with individual effects (e.g., foraging velocity, ingestion rates; Dell et al. [@bib17]) lead to shifts in species interaction strengths (disease prevalence, Kock et al. [@bib41]; parasitism rate, Runjie et al. [@bib72]), ultimately translating to change in community dynamics and structure (Kordas et al. [@bib42], Bellard et al. [@bib9]).\n\nEnvironmental temperature is highly variable in both space and time. Some aspects of environmental temperature are predictable (e.g., seasonal changes), others are not (e.g., extreme events). Therefore, a *temperature regime* has multiple dimensions that can be described in both space and time, with the potential to shape biological patterns in different ways (Garcia et al. [@bib25]). For example, as we move from the tropics to the poles, it becomes"

"Background {#Sec1}\n==========\n\nThe science of sitting and sedentariness, which comprises research on behaviors such as TV viewing, sitting at work and sitting for transport, is considered an emerging public health field. Evidence on the health risks of sitting is accumulating, with studies among large cohorts of adults showing detrimental effects of sitting on all-cause mortality \\[[@CR1]--[@CR3]\\], cardio metabolic risk profiles \\[[@CR1], [@CR4]--[@CR6]\\] and mental health \\[[@CR7]\\]. Too much sitting can thus be hazardous to population health, even though its health implications seem to be attenuated by physical activity participation \\[[@CR8]\\].\n\nSimilar to trends in the US and the UK, sitting time of Asian adults, such as Chinese and Indians, is predicted to rise over the next decade \\[[@CR9]\\]. Moreover, current research among adults from other countries in Asia found that they engage in high levels of sitting too. For example, results from a Singapore population-based study showed that 37% of the 2319 participants included in the study, sat for at least 8\u00a0h a\u00a0day \\[[@CR10]\\].

Between 3.7--3.9% of adults in France and the USA self-report physician diagnosed gout, while 2.5% of UK adults have gout according to their primary care healthcare records [@bib0005], [@bib0010], [@bib0015]. The incidence and prevalence of this condition are rising mainly due to an ageing population, and the obesity epidemic [@bib0020]. Gout is also the only rheumatic disease whose aetiopathogenesis is well understood, and which can potentially be cured by removal of the pathogenic agents (urate crystals) [@bib0025]. Current guidelines recommend the use of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) for people with recurrent flares or with complications such as tophi, renal stones, joint damage or impaired renal function [@bib0030], [@bib0035], [@bib0040]. Up-titration of ULT to reduce and maintain serum urate (SU) levels below 360\u2009\u03bcmol/L is the key to achieving long-term control of gout [@bib0030], [@bib0035], [@bib0040].\n\nThe uptake of ULTs is an important factor in its long-term management. Despite the availability of effective pharmacologic therapies, management of the condition remains suboptimal [@bib0045], [@bib0050]: only 30%--40% of patients with gout are ever prescribed ULTs [@bib0005], [@bib0055], [@bib0060] and there is frequent absence of regular monitoring and dose up-titration against a target"
"A consequence of the modular organization of the eukaryotic cytoplasm into membrane-bound organelles is an increase in the efficiency of metabolic processes. Such arrangement provides tailored microenvironments for chemical reactions in the cell. The modular organization is associated with a subtle equilibrium between proliferation and degradation of all subcellular compartments. For proliferation, organellar membranes are remodeled in a restricted area to accommodate altered protein and lipid composition, leading to polarization of the organelle. Polarizing events are usually initiated by the insertion of morphogenic proteins which alter the membrane curvature and sustain protrusion of this membrane ([@b1],[@b2]). A consequence thereof is local membrane instability, which is ultimately resolved by fission. Accordingly at the onset of peroxisome proliferation, extensions form at the peroxisomal membrane ([@b3],[@b4]). The number of peroxisomes per cell increases through growth and division of pre-existing peroxisomes ([@b5]) or, when required, peroxisome biogenesis is initiated *de novo* at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ([@b6]--[@b11]). These processes are controlled and executed by peroxins (PEX proteins) which act to maintain the peroxisomal compartment thereby sustaining cellular homeostasis.\n\nConceptually, peroxisome proliferation can be divided into five steps. Initially, proliferation needs to be spatiotemporally defined at the peroxisomal membrane (step 1), leading to polarized growth"
"Background\n==========\n\nSudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a subset of sudden hearing loss (SHL) which affects nearly to 20 per 100,000 in populations \\[[@B1]\\]. Due to its debilitating nature and sudden course, patients often immediately seek medical care. If SSNHL is diagnosed and managed on time, chance of hearing recovery as well as patient quality of life will be increased. For diagnosis of SSNHL, hearing impairment should have rapid onset, occurring over a 72-hour period, and a reduction in hearing of \u226530 decibels (dB) and at least 3 successive audiometric frequencies should be present in the audiometric test. Based on the latest clinical practice guidelines, computerized tomography should not be ordered in the initial evaluation of these patients \\[[@B2]\\]. Although SSNHL has a very long list of etiologies, the etiology remains unknown in nearly 90% of cases despite thorough evaluation \\[[@B3]\\]. Thus, due to uncertain etiology in most cases, treatment of SSNHL is mainly empiric and usually consists of corticosteroids, \\[[@B4]\\] antivirals, antibiotics, diuretics and mineral supplements \\[[@B4],[@B5]\\]. Also, if a potential drug is suspected to cause SSNHL, it must be stopped promptly.\n\nCase presentation\n=================\n\nA 23\u00a0years old female presented to the emergency department with acute bilateral"

Despite this, over 90 million infants still lack access to a rotavirus vaccine [@b0055]. The recent WHO prequalification of Rotavac (Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India) and Rotasiil (Serum Institute of India, Pune, India) may alleviate cost and supply barriers, however there remains the challenge of sub-optimal efficacy of the current vaccines in low-income countries [@b0045].The human neonatal rotavirus vaccine, RV3-BB, is in clinical development with a birth dose vaccination schedule to address some of these challenges. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial undertaken in Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia demonstrated the efficacy of RV3-BB when given in a neonatal (first dose 0--5\u202fdays of age) or infant (first dose 8--10\u202fweeks of age) schedule [@b0010].\n\nThe implementation of RV3-BB with a birth dose requires co-administration with other vaccines in the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule.

"INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nIntracranial intraparenchymal schwannomas, which are unrelated to the cranial nerves, are very rare. Since Gibson et al.[@B7] reported the first case of an intracerebral schwannoma located at the temporal lobe in 1966, about 70 cases have been reported in the English-language literature. Although some general characteristics of these tumors have been described, preoperative diagnosis is very challenging due to its rarity in the central nervous system and because of the absence of pathognomonic signs on radiologic images. Often, these challenges lead to delay in proper treatment of the patient.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first case of a supratentorial intracerebral schwannoma reported in Korea. The patient had an exceptionally long preoperative observational period (9 years) which allowed us to clarify the clinical and radiological course of this rare tumor.

"Introduction {#sec1}\n============\n\nKidney diseases are a global health burden with steadily increasing incidence ([@B1]--[@B4]), leading to an estimated worldwide death toll of 2 million per year from AKI ([@B5]--[@B7]). The currently available methods of assessing risk and therapeutic options for AKI are limited ([@B5], [@B6], [@B8]--[@B10]). Although a number of biochemical markers are being evaluated for use in diagnosis, risk assessment, and prognosis of AKI, there are currently no specific biomarkers that permit point-of-care diagnosis for early-stage AKI ([@B4], [@B11], [@B12]). Translational approaches for the assessment of early-stage AKI and for the study of renoprotective strategies are urgently required ([@B13]--[@B16]). Strategies under consideration include novel imaging techniques that may be customized to probe early stages of AKI ([@B12], [@B16]--[@B18]).\n\nEarly features in the pathophysiology of AKI that could lend themselves to detection by noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging include renal tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia---factors that are also important during the progression from AKI to chronic kidney diseases ([@B16], [@B19]--[@B25]).

"Academic cancer centres have a longstanding tradition of conducting research contributing to discoveries and generalizable knowledge. The benefits of these discoveries have not always translated equitably to all communities. Dr. Harold Freemen suggested this \"discovery-to-delivery\" disconnect as a critical contributor to cancer health inequities, further exacerbated by overlapping factors (poverty, obesogenic environments, and social injustice) [@bib0001] collectively described by John Galtung in 1969 as \"structural violence.\" While cancer incidence and mortality has declined across all racial/ethnic groups, the enduring gaps between racial/ethnic groups stem largely from differences in the upstream determinants of health, including policies negatively impacting these groups.\n\nThe inconsistent integration of community input into existing research frameworks also perpetuates cancer inequities across the research continuum. While frameworks such as the community-based participatory research (CBPR) have integrated community stakeholders in population health research [@bib0002], such integration seldom occurs in the basic and clinical/translational sciences. Moreover, CBPR rarely impacts the design and/or development of interventional clinical trials and emerging fields such as big data sciences.
